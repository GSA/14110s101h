<h3>Executive Order 14110</h3>
<p>
  Executive Order 14110 Section 10.1(h) directed GSA to facilitate agencies’
  access to commercial Generative AI capabilities.
</p>
<p>
  “Within 180 days of the date of this order, to facilitate agencies’ access to
  commercial AI capabilities, the Administrator of General Services, in
  coordination with the Director of OMB, and in collaboration with the Secretary
  of Defense, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Director of National
  Intelligence, the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space
  Administration, and the head of any other agency identified by the
  Administrator of General Services, shall take steps consistent with applicable
  law to facilitate access to Federal Government-wide acquisition solutions for
  specified types of AI services and products, such as through the creation of a
  resource guide or other tools to assist the acquisition workforce.
  Specified types of AI capabilities shall include generative AI and specialized
  computing infrastructure.”
</p>
<h3>GenAI is not all of AI</h3>
<p>
  This is about Generative Artificial Intelligence, not all Artificial
  Intelligence. This guide focuses on Generative AI acquisition and will not
  focus on AI acquisition as a whole.
</p>

<h3 id="audience">Assisting the Acquisition Workforce</h3>
<p>
  This guide is primarily meant for government purchasers and acquisition
  professionals navigating the complexities of acquiring Generative AI
  technologies.
</p>

<p>
  Generative AI can be very difficult to understand especially for someone who
  isn’t a technologist.
</p>

<p>
  As an acquisition professional, it is critical to work with both technical
  subject matter experts (SMEs) and program staff who can speak to their own
  needs and goals.
</p>

<p>
  While those in the acquisition community probably don’t need to become experts
  in AI, a basic understanding of certain Generative AI terms will help you make
  better decisions about what to buy and how.
</p>

<p>
  To help, this guide also attempts to simplify complex technical IT and AI
  concepts to make them easier for non-technologists to understand. In some
  cases, this guide may over-simplify for the sake of clarity; apologies for any
  problems this causes.
</p>

<h3 id="version">This is Version 1.0</h3>
<p>
  This guide isn’t static. It’s meant to evolve as technology advances while
  aligning with the Executive Order on AI, the OMB directive, federal laws, the
  Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), the NIST AI Risk Management Framework
  (AI RMF), and the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights.

<h2>1.1 Key Definitions</h2>

<h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3>
<p>15 U.S.C. 9401(3) defines “Artificial Intelligence” as:</p>
<p>
  “a machine-based system that can, for a given set of human-defined objectives,
  make predictions, recommendations, or decisions influencing real or virtual
  environments. Artificial intelligence systems use machine- and human-based
  inputs to perceive real and virtual environments; abstract such perceptions
  into models through analysis in an automated manner; and use model inference
  to formulate options for information or action.”
</p>

<p>
  More simply, it refers to making computers and robots that learn how to think
  and act like humans.
</p>

<h3>Generative Artificial Intelligence, Generative AI and GenAI</h3>
<p>Executive Order 14110 defines “Generative Artificial Intelligence” as:</p>
<p>
  “the class of AI models that emulate the structure and characteristics of
  input data in order to generate derived synthetic content. This can
  include images, videos, audio, text, and other digital content.”
</p>

<p>
  The Government Accountability Office defines Generative Artificial
  Intelligence as:
</p>
<p>
  “technology that can create content, including text, images, audio, or video,
  when prompted by a user. Generative AI systems create responses using
  algorithms that are trained often on open-source information, such as text and
  images from the internet. However, generative AI systems are not cognitive and
  lack human judgment.”
</p>

<p>
  This guide uses Generative Artificial Intelligence, Generative AI and GenAI to
  mean the same thing.
</p>

<h3>Cloud</h3>
<p>NIST defines “Cloud Computing” as:</p>
<p>
  “a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a
  shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers,
  storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and
  released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.”
</p>

<p>
  We tend to think of the “cloud” as the interconnected network of servers in
  data centers where information, data and software are stored and accessed.
</p>

<h3>Application Programming Interface (API)</h3>
<p>NIST defines “API” as:</p>
<p>
  “A system access point or library function that has a well-defined syntax and
  is accessible from application programs or user code to provide well-defined
  functionality.”
</p>

<p>
  Simply, APIs are digital tools that act like translators or docks, allowing
  two pieces of software to easily exchange data with one another.
</p>

<h3>Machine Learning</h3>
<p>Executive Order 14110 defines “Machine Learning” as:</p>
<p>
  “A set of techniques that can be used to train AI algorithms to improve
  performance at a task based on data.”
</p>

<p>
  Basically machine learning is about creating software that can, without too
  much human interaction, analyze data, find patterns and develop its own way of
  “thinking.”

<h2>1.2 A Basic Overview of Generative AI</h2>

<p>
  Here is a simplified crash course into Generative Artificial Intelligence or
  “GenAI.”
</p>

<h4>Type ahead is a simple example of artificial intelligence.</h4>
<p>
  We’ve all seen the basic version of artificial intelligence in computers and
  smartphones.
</p>

<p>
  When we are writing an email or composing a text message the software suggests
  what the next word we might want to type is. That “type ahead” feature is an
  example of basic artificial intelligence in action.
</p>

<p>
  Type ahead relies on the most fundamental building block of Generative AI
  tools, called “fundamental models.” Simply put these models are pieces of
  software that represent the way we as humans think as hundreds of lines of
  computer code, data and algorithms.
</p>

<p>
  Type ahead uses one of these fundamental models to predict your next word
  based on what most people have written and what you’ve written in other
  sentences.
</p>

<p>Pretty simple, right?</p>

<h4>The Rise of Large Language Models</h4>
<p>
  We can now go much farther than simple type ahead or word suggestions.
</p>

<p>
  That’s because in the last few years we’ve created more sophisticated
  artificial intelligence models. These new models have learned how we construct
  sentences, paragraphs and longer pieces of writing.
</p>

<p>
  The creators of these models gathered trillions of pieces of written language,
  from encyclopedia entries and literature to social media posts and song
  lyrics. They used all that data to “train” their models.
</p>

<p>
  Those humans wrote computer code and “algorithms” that looked at every word
  and phrase and analyzed how they connect to one another: What do those words
  mean? Which words tend to show up near others? What words are used in which
  contexts?
</p>

<p>
  The algorithms looked for patterns and statistics in the interrelationships of
  words and phrases. And the software kept track of the results.
</p>

<p>
  All of that together created a powerful kind of fundamental model called a
  “Large Language Model” or LLM.
</p>

<h4>From LLMs to GenAI</h4>
<p>This is where things got really interesting.</p>

<p>
  The human model creators also figured out how to build those LLMs to get
  really good at responding to simple human questions and prompts. The LLMs
  could interpret the language that a person was inputting, understand what it
  should do and serve back a response.
</p>

<p>
  So they built simple chat interfaces that like text messages would allow
  someone to write a simple prompt or question and have the tool respond.
</p>

<p>
  The tool wouldn’t just search all the trillions of pieces of written language
  information in its memory and serve up potential answers. It would actually
  use its understanding of language to create new phrases and sentences and give
  an answer. The artificial intelligence system would generate content; hence,
  Generative AI.
</p>

<p>
  Another big benefit of the chat interface has been that someone could ask the
  system to improve the output in specific ways: make the tone more friendly,
  use fewer bullets, say more about this specific issue referencing the events
  of the last few months. In this way, humans can keep shaping and refining the
  output from Generative AI systems. And after a few rounds of refinement, we
  can get something very close to what we want.
</p>

<p>
  (Note: Large Language Models nowadays are often called Generative Pre-Trained
  Transformers or GPTs. Pairing a “Chat” function with a “GPT” is what gave the
  popular GenAI product its name. While GPTs and LLMs are technically different,
  you can think of them as about the same for the purpose of GenAI acquisition.)
</p>

<h4>Beyond Text</h4>
<p>
  From there companies and researchers started creating other kinds of
  fundamental models and teaching them to learn how to analyze and find patterns
  in different inputs.
</p>

<p>
  People started feeding the new models photographs and paintings, songs and
  speeches, videos and animation, computer code and numerical data. And the
  models learned how these kinds of content worked.
</p>

<p>
  With a similar chat-based interface it became pretty easy to now ask for more
  than a written text response. Now these fundamental models could generate
  images, music, movies and smartphone apps.
</p>

<p>
  As time goes on and models get better, the ability of these artificial
  intelligence tools to generate more sophisticated content has only increased.
</p>
<h2>1.3 Unique Benefits of Generative AI</h2>

<h4>Create and Refine Content</h4>
<p>
  Probably the biggest value that Generative AI tools offer is the ability to
  create text, pictures, sounds, videos and even computer code.
</p>

<p>
  The best GenAI tools will mine the information available in its training data
  or on the internet, much like a search engine, then combine it with its own
  pattern-making to construct sentences, paragraphs, graphics and other
  outputs.
</p>

<p>
  Users then have the ability to shape, refine and adjust the outputs to make
  them what users want and need. This allows a user to make rough prototypes,
  first drafts and initial passes at content very quickly then spent time
  editing, curating, adjusting and refining rather than having to create from a
  blank page.
</p>

<h4>Easy, Chat-Based Interface</h4>
<p>
  Generative AI systems typically respond to questions and requests that a
  person types into a chat or text box. The GenAI tools then create text,
  pictures, sounds or videos to respond to those prompts.
</p>

<p>
  The person can then refine and improve the output by typing more specific
  directions or guidance into the prompt box and the GenAI tool can iterate what
  it created to better suit what the person wants.
</p>

<p>
  Interestingly, there is a growing area of expertise called “prompt
  engineering” describing people’s skills in crafting the right words, context,
  examples and guidance to type into chat interfaces to iterate and get the
  right output from different GenAI systems.
</p>

<h4>Customize How They Work</h4>
<p>
  Generative AI tools often allow both programmers and end users to alter them.
  People can train a model using different data so it can learn the patterns of
  specific kinds of information. This can be especially useful if an
  organization wants to use the Generative AI tool for a specific purpose.
</p>

<p>
  For example, an agency could train a model using its own agency policies,
  data, regulations and action with the goal that the model would provide more
  agency-specific outputs.
</p>

<p>
  Models can also be “fine tuned,” meaning you can change how the model works,
  adjusting what it should treat as more important or less important. You can
  even change what it outputs to make it more relevant, such as following a
  particular style of writing or imagery.
</p>

<p>
  And if no existing model seems to come close you can create your own model
  then train it with custom data, fine tune how it works and tailor the outputs
  to meet your specific needs.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>1.4. Risks of Generative AI</h2>
<h3>Misinformation and Disinformation</h3>
<p>
  Generative AI can create highly realistic but false content, such as
  “deepfakes” – images, audio, video or text which make it look like someone
  said or did something they didn’t. This can be used to spread falsehoods that
  polarize people, destabilize communities and even incite crimes.
</p>

<h3>AI Hallucinations</h3>
<p>
  Generative AI models can produce incorrect or nonsensical outputs, often
  because of limitations in their training data or algorithms. These
  “hallucinations” can lead to misinformation, incorrect decisions,
  misinterpretations, which can lead to flawed policy decisions or misinformed
  public statements.
</p>

<h3>Bias and Discrimination</h3>
<p>
  AI systems, if they have been trained on discriminatory or one-sided data, can
  lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes in public services. Importantly,
  E.O. 14110 charges Chief Artificial Intelligence Officers (CAIOs) with
  ensuring their agency’s AI will advance equity, dignity, and fairness.
</p>

<h3>Prompt Manipulation</h3>
<p>
  There is a risk of GenAI systems providing biased or misleading outputs,
  especially if the prompts people input contain incorrect or slanted
  information. Malicious actors could exploit this to generate harmful content,
  spread disinformation, or extract sensitive data.
</p>

<h3>Regulatory and Legal Compliance</h3>
<p>
  The use of Generative AI must be carefully evaluated to ensure compliance with
  policies such as E.O. 14110 and the NIST AI Risk Management Framework to
  include considerations around transparency, accountability, and ethical use.
</p>

<h3>Security/Cybersecurity Risks</h3>
<p>
  Generative AI can be exploited for cyber-attacks, including sophisticated
  phishing and malware that evades detection, and is vulnerable to adversarial
  attacks aimed at manipulating outputs. Insecure AI systems risk data theft and
  sabotage, undermining public trust and national security.
</p>

<h3>Privacy Risks</h3>
<p>
  Generative AI’s need for extensive data raises concerns over inadvertent
  privacy breaches and the ethical use of personal information. It poses risks
  of unauthorized surveillance and synthetic data creation that infringes on
  privacy rights, necessitating strict data protection and privacy law
  compliance.
</p>

<h3>Intellectual Property and Plagiarism</h3>
<p>
  Generative AI raises complex issues regarding copyright infringement and
  originality. This poses significant challenges for determining the ownership
  and originality of AI-generated works.
</p>
<h3>Environmental Impact</h3>
<p>
  Similar to cloud computing, training and operating large AI models requires
  substantial computational resources, leading to significant electricity usage.
  Additionally, the production and disposal of the specialized computing
  hardware (like GPUs and CPUs) necessary for AI development involve
  resource-intensive processes and contribute to electronic waste. This
  environmental impact is compounded by the infrastructure needs of data
  centers, including land usage and cooling systems.
</p>

<h3>Model Training Delay</h3>
<p>
  Since there is a time lag between when the model is trained and when the model
  is used there is a risk that the model doesn’t reflect current norms,
  regulations, or realities, which could cause the AI tool to generate
  irrelevant or inappropriate outputs.
</p>

<h3>Ownership</h3>
<p>
  Generative AI tools create data based on the inputs that it has been trained
  on and new data inputted by user. Aside from the intellectual property issues
  mentioned above, there are significant concerns over who owns the inputted and
  outputted data, most of which have not yet been decided by legal experts. If a
  user inputs documents for the GenAI tool use is that data now owned by the
  company who owns the GenAI tool or does the user still own it? If the GenAI
  created lines of computer code is that code now owned by the user or the
  company who owns the GenAI tool? Is the GenAI tool allowed to “learn” from the
  data it created and use it to create code for some other user?
</p>
<h2>1.5 Typical Generative AI Tools</h2>

<p>
  So what kind of Generative AI tools exist right now that an agency may want to
  buy or get access to? Here are a few examples and how they might be used by an
  agency.
</p>

<h3>GenAI-Enabled ChatBots</h3>
<p>
  Applications that are capable of answering a series of related questions or
  prompts in a conversational tone. These can be used to respond to the public’s
  inquiries on policies, services, programs and products.
</p>

<h3>Text Summarizers</h3>
<p>
  Tools that can take in reports, legal documents, case files and other
  documents, analyze the information and produce summaries. This can reduce the
  time to review documents and allow an agency user to focus on the most
  relevant content.
</p>

<h3>Data Analyzers</h3>
<p>
  Software that can crawl through large amounts of numerical data, organize and
  structure it, find patterns and anomalies, create visualizations and make
  projections based on what it finds. This can save effort and enable agency
  staff to do higher level analysis.
</p>

<h3>Explainer and Tutoring Tools</h3>
<p>
  Modules which can generate natural language explanations and teach users
  through a process, an application or form or a reporting requirement. This can
  reduce frustration with processes and increase the completeness and accuracy
  of document submissions.
</p>

<h3>Text to Image Generators</h3>
<p>
  Programs that let an end user quickly produce images and visuals by describing
  images in text prompts. These can enhance the creation of pictures, diagrams,
  illustrations, and graphics for use in training materials and product guides.
</p>

<h3>Coding Assistants</h3>
<p>
  Applications that can write new computer code, update and improve legacy code,
  translate code from one language to another, find and use appropriate code
  libraries, detect errors in code and recommend changes. These can reduce the
  time programmers spend developing or modernizing code.
</p>

<h3>Language Translators</h3>
<p>
  Tools to analyze text in multiple languages, recognize differences in written
  and spoken language, understand context and properly interpret words to have
  the right meaning. These can be useful for agencies needing to translate
  materials into multiple languages.
</p>

<h3>Search and Recommendation</h3>
<p>
  Add-on functions that improve search results by considering the broader
  context of users’ queries and interpreting more from what users ask. This can
  help systems find the pieces of information that a user didn’t ask for but
  provide the information they really need.

<h1 id="chapter2">2. Generative AI in the Government</h1>
<p>
  GenAI tools can enhance accuracy and precision by automating and refining data
  processing, analysis, and decision-making processes, all while reducing human
  errors in data entry, analysis, and interpretation. In processing vast amounts
  of data, GenAI algorithms can identify patterns and anomalies with a level of
  accuracy beyond human capability. This leads to more accurate insights for
  policy making, operational planning, and service delivery. Additionally,
  AI-driven tools can ensure consistency in communications and reporting,
  further enhancing the reliability of information disseminated by federal
  agencies.
</p>

<h2>2.1 Generative AI in Government Examples</h2>
<p>
  By providing accurate predictive analytics, GenAI also aids in better
  forecasting and scenario planning, crucial for strategic decision-making
  across various sectors of government operations. Here are a few examples of
  how the Government is currently using Generative AI:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <h4>DHS Commercial Generative AI for Text, Image and Code Generation</h4>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  DHS employees are permitted to use commercially available Generative AI for
  day-to-day work including generating first drafts of documents that a human
  would subsequently review, conducting and synthesizing research on open-source
  information, developing briefing materials, dynamically creating graphical
  content through text prompts, and creating usable computer code. (Reference:
  <a class="external_link" href="https://www.dhs.gov/data/AI_inventory"
    >https://www.dhs.gov/data/AI_inventory</a
  >)
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <h4>FEMA Hazard Mitigation Plan Creation Tool</h4>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  FEMA will launch a GenAI pilot to create efficiencies for the hazard
  mitigation planning process for local governments, including underserved
  communities. Hazard mitigation plans are not only a foundational step that
  communities can take to build their resilience but can be lengthy to produce
  and challenging for communities that lack resources to do so. The pilot will
  specifically support State, Local, Tribal, and Territorial governments’
  understanding of how to craft a plan that identifies risks and mitigation
  strategies as well as generate draft plan elements—from publicly-available,
  well-researched sources — that governments could customize to meet their
  needs. This pilot could lead to more communities having the ability to submit
  grant applications for funding to become more resilient and reduce disaster
  risks. (Reference:

<p>
  Department of Education’s Federal Student Aid virtual assistant uses natural
  language processing to answer common financial aid questions and help
  customers get information about their federal aid on StudentAid.gov. In just
  over two years, Aidan has interacted with over 2.6 million unique customers,
  resulting in more than 11 million user messages. (Reference:

<p>
  National Institute of Health’s National Library of Medicine developed a
  Large-Language Model to help match patients to clinical trials based on
  physicians’ notes. The system looked at trial restrictions and assessed
  patient eligibility to identify who might be good candidates and who might
  need to be excluded. The initial experiments of TrialGPT were run on data from

  Many other agencies have begun their AI journeys with pilots and experiments.
  The Federal Reserve Board has started a Generative AI “incubator” that is
  looking at testing hypotheses and seeing how different solutions perform. They
  have data from all the different payment systems they oversee that could
  provide insights about opportunities and problems in the customer experience.
  NASA has begun running experiments using Generative AI systems to help write
  computer code, saving software programmers time by taking the first shot and
  doing some initial heavy lifting that humans can then focus on reviewing,
  improving, testing and transforming.

<h2></h2>
<h2>2.2 Emerging Project Areas and Use Cases</h2>

<p>
  The value of Generative AI tools is expanding as more individuals and
  companies experiment with Large Language Models, AI-enabled chatbots and
  content generators. Some of them have potential applications for the
  government to increase their own efficiencies, lower operating costs, and
  prevent and detect criminal activity against the government.
</p>

<h3>Automated Documentation Drafting</h3>
<p>
  Using custom GPTs, Generative AI tools can assist in creating initial drafts
  of required documents for caseworkers, contracting officers, and other
  government professionals for repetitive or common tasks.
</p>

<h3>Fraud Detection in Financial Transactions</h3>
<p>
  Utilizing pattern recognition and trend analysis of financial data, Generative
  AI can identify fraudulent activities in federal financial systems by flagging
  inconsistencies in the data sets for further human review and
  decision.
</p>

<h3>Synthetic Data Generation</h3>
<p>
  Generative AI can create sample data sets to test software for functionality
  and scalability, potentially reducing the development timeline for new
  products or modification and personalization of commercial software by
  eliminating or reducing the need to provide and/or clean actual government
  data.
</p>

<h3>Cybersecurity Threat Detection</h3>
<p>
  Using a generative AI model trained on historical cyber data like network
  traffic and user interactions, cyber professionals can identify patterns and
  trends allowing them to anticipate and respond to cyber threats against
  federal IT systems.
</p>

<h3>Human Resource Management</h3>
<p>
  Generative AI can assist in summarizing resumes, personalizing recruitment
  activities, drafting job descriptions, interview guides and training
  materials.
</p>

<h3>Modernizing and Managing Software Code</h3>
<p>
  Generative AI can help agency software developers draft new code, translate
  and transform legacy code, and identify potentially outdated or compromised
  code libraries in existing products.
</p>

<h3>Energy Consumption Analysis</h3>
<p>
  By analyzing historical weather trends and utilities usage, Generative AI can
  help predict scenarios and optimize energy usage in federal buildings.
</p>

<h3>AI-Enabled Training Simulations</h3>
<p>
  Generative AI can be used to develop virtual training environments and create
  interactive scenarios based on organizational policies, doctrine and norms.
  This allows for more realistic interactions before an employee is put into a
  new role or when a new policy is created.
</p>

<h3>Customizing Citizen Engagement</h3>
<p>
  AI can personalize communication with citizens based on their interactions
  with government services. Through the use of intelligent chatbots, agencies
  can provide a level of automated customer service for government services,
  more quickly and effectively resolving inquiries from the public.
</p>

<h1 id="chapter3">3. Generative AI Procurement</h1>
<h2>Key Considerations</h2>
<p>
  Acquiring Generative AI solutions can look very similar to other complex
  software acquisitions plus a few specific considerations.
</p>

<h3>Try before buy.</h3>
<p>
  No two Generative AI systems work exactly the same. That’s because they have
  all been programmed and trained on different data. What a supplier says their
  product can do might be close to what you want or need but may require tweaks
  to really make them work. At the same time, Generative AI systems are also
  evolving rapidly. So functions that don’t exist now might be available later.
  It’s critical to test solutions before actually doing a full-scale purchase to
  ensure the Generative AI products meet your specific agency needs.
</p>

<h3>Prioritize data management.</h3>
<p>
  Unlike many other software tools, Generative AI systems are built to ingest
  lots of data, find patterns, learn from every new piece of data inputted and
  combine them when serving up answers. It’s critical to know what data was used
  to build and train the system initially. It’s even more important to know how
  the data you input will be used to train the system and make it better. And of
  course, you need to know how the data you input might be outputted to other
  users when responding to their prompts.
</p>

<h3>Control consumption costs.</h3>
<p>
  GenAI systems are software systems. Suppliers bill for them mostly like other
  “Software as a Service” (SaaS) tools with some slight variants. You often need
  to pay for both monthly access plus how much time you use it plus how
  much data you input or output. Those costs can grow quickly and unpredictably
  if no one is monitoring both how teams are using the GenAI tool and what their
  bills are. It’s important to setup systems to accurately forecast and check
  actual costs against the budget when using GenAI tools.
</p>

<h2></h2>
<h2>Acquisition Process</h2>

<p>
  Here is an acquisition process for Generative AI solutions that integrates
  these ideas.
</p>

<p><a href="#3.1">3.1 Start with Your Agency’s Needs.</a></p>
<p><a href="#3.2">3.2 Assemble a Cross-Agency Team.</a></p>
<p><a href="#3.3">3.3 Scope and Test Solutions.</a></p>

<p><a href="#3.7">3.7 Estimate Costs.</a></p>
<p><a href="#3.8">3.8 Monitor and Evaluate.</a></p>

<h2></h2>
<h2><a id="3.1" name="3.1">3.1 Start with Your Agency’s Needs.</a></h2>

<p>
  There are many different types of Generative AI products and services, each
  with their own strengths.
</p>

<p>
  Don’t jump to a particular solution first. Instead, begin by understanding
  what program staff want to do and achieve, then find the right solutions and
  suppliers that will best help them.
</p>

<p>
  Clearly define what the agency aims to achieve. Focus on specific problems you
  want to solve with Generative AI, the opportunities the agency wants to
  pursue, the gaps of current tools and the desired outcomes.
</p>

<p>
  Sometimes just by posing these questions an agency can determine that it
  already has non-Generative AI tools that can be deployed quickly or that the
  problems themselves aren’t worth the investment to solve.
</p>

<p>
  Many agencies are in a space of needing or wanting to experiment or “do
  something” with Generative AI solutions to understand what the technology can
  do. Technical experimentation is healthy and important for agencies. If your
  agency is just trying to get exposure to Generative AI tools and their
  capabilities, start with smaller problems and perhaps ones that are not
  mission critical, but ones that can’t be easily solved with current
  non-Generative AI tools.
</p>

<p>
  For ideas and inspiration of what problems and projects might be good to work
  on, see sections 1 and 2 of this guide. Agency use cases are also published on
  <a class="external_link" href="http://ai.gov">AI.gov</a> and may also be on
  your agency website.
</p>

<h2></h2>
<h2><a id="3.2" name="3.2">3.2. Assemble a Cross-Agency Team.</a></h2>

<p>
  Generative AI procurement is not just a procurement or IT department task.
  Many agencies have consolidated their AI decision making under a Chief
  Artificial Intelligence Officer (CAIO).
</p>

<p>
  As a start, work with the agency’s CAIO and program officials to understand
  the maturity of the agency’s IT and AI capabilities, policies, and skills.
  Your agency may already be using Generative AI tools and may be familiar with
  how to best work with them.
</p>

<p>
  Create an Integrated Product Team (IPT) drawing from across the agency or
  sub-agency. Integrated Product Teams are successful because each role brings
  different perspectives and knowledge. Given the complex and cross-cutting
  nature of many Generative AI decisions it is helpful to have multiple voices
  and ideas to work through thorny challenges.
</p>

<p>
  Led by a technical program manager, the team should consist of program staff
  who can voice needs and advocate for the agency’s mission, AI practitioners,
  software engineers, data engineers, security experts, privacy officials and
  acquisition professionals. Finance, legal and other representatives will need
  to be brought in along the way.
</p>

<p>
  Their main goals should be to set the project objectives and constraints,
  research and vet solutions, and identify potential risks and consequences. The
  team will also identify and review agency related AI policies and guidance.
</p>

<p>The IPT should address these types of issues:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Integration and interoperability of solutions with existing systems and data
  </li>
  <li>Data rights</li>
  <li>Intellectual property provisions</li>
  <li>End-user licensing agreements</li>
  <li>Appropriations implications for different types of pricing</li>
  <li>Security measures to start a pilot or scale a solution</li>
  <li>Performance testing, monitoring and control</li>
</ul>
<p>
  <br />
  
</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2><a id="3.3" name="3.3">3.3 Scope and Test Solutions.</a></h2>

<p>
  It’s often difficult to know which Generative AI tool will be best for your
  agency’s purposes. That’s why it’s always best to spend time actually trying
  them out first. See which tools have the right combinations of functions and
  features that work with the data you have and help you get to the goals you
  want to achieve.
</p>

<h3>3.3.1 Use cloud-platform sandboxes to experiment and learn what works.</h3>
<p>
  “Sandboxes” are test beds that agencies can use to experiment with Generative
  AI tools. Think of them as low scale versions of tech you are exploring. These
  sandboxes allow you to try different tools and identify which ones work best
  for your agency’s needs. They can also help you more accurately estimate the
  amount of effort and cost it might take to complete the project.
</p>

<p>
  A subset of the Integrated Product Team (IPT) can bring their expertise in
  data, workflows and security to scope the sandbox and begin running tests with
  actual data and different Generative AI tools. They can then assess which
  tools will best fit their goals and what tools or access to tools the agency
  should acquire.
</p>

<p>
  In many cases, the IPT will create a sandbox on a cloud platform that allows
  them to upload their own data and try different Generative AI modules to see
  what kinds of results each gives. Because most Generative AI tools are
  available through cloud platforms this is an easy and relatively quick way to
  get started.
</p>

<p>
  Some IPTs may even decide to set up multiple sandboxes on a few different
  cloud platforms so they can test both which modules work best and which
  platforms offer the most flexibility, lowest cost and best return on
  investment.
</p>

<p>
  Typically setting up and using these sandboxes can happen under the Simplified
  Acquisition Threshold (SAT).
</p>

<h3>3.3.2 Identify the most effective solutions.</h3>
<p>
  With some sense of what combinations of platform and Generative AI tools work
  for the data the agency has and the outcomes it wants, the IPT can determine
  what the agency will need to acquire.
</p>

<p>
  The agency may require access to a new cloud platform or to change the terms
  of how you use an existing platform. The IPT may decide it needs to have
  access to several different Generative AI tools. The experiments they ran in
  the sandbox may show the need for several accounts and lots of “credits” to
  scale up operations. Engineers may decide that they want to be able to
  integrate Generative AI functions into their own systems and need access to
  APIs.
</p>

<p>
  Determine the products and services that the IPT needs to succeed, the
  quantities, the performance requirements and any other specifications needed
  to write a clear statement about what the agency is interested in purchasing.
  If the IPT needs a specific supplier’s products, start to assemble the
  information for a brand-name justification
</p>

<h3>3.3.3 Understand more sophisticated Generative AI options</h3>
<p>
  The IPT may have greater ambitions and their sandbox tests prove that they
  need more sophisticated capabilities. They may want to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Fine-tune a Pre-Trained Model. LLMs rely on algorithms where different
    connections and information are given more or less “weight” or significance.
    Fine tuning is a process of changing those weights so different information
    is treated as more or less important.
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    Customize a Pre-Trained Model. LLMs are trained on a certain set of initial
    data. The LLM can be customized further with more up-to-date information or
    information relevant to a specific field which makes it significantly more
    useful or even links to searchable databases.
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    Train and Fine-Tune a Model. A team may decide that they want to take the
    basic architecture and algorithms of an LLM and train it on completely
    different data and weight the information in a very specific way. This can
    give a specialized result meant for a particular purpose.
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    Build Their Own Model. A team may want to develop everything themselves from
    the ground up, crafting their own algorithms, determining their own weights
    of what information is more important and training it with its own data.
    This is a significant lift but may be necessary for very specific
    high-security applications.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Typically these kinds of projects require greater effort and expertise so IPTs
  should think deeply about the investment and whether the agency truly requires
  it.
</p>

<h2><a id="3.4" name="3.4">3.4 Specify How Data will be Used.</a></h2>

<p>
  Data is at the heart of all Generative AI tools. The fundamental models are
  trained on billions and trillions of pieces of data. Users can put new data in
  and the models will learn from that data. And of course GenAI tools create
  text, images and a whole host of other data. Properly protecting and managing
  that data is therefore a critical consideration for any GenAI
  acquisition.
</p>

<h3>3.4.1 Keep data security at the forefront</h3>
<p>
  Security is a top concern because agencies are working with government and
  public data. At the most basic level, data has to be securely stored and
  securely transmitted. All data, even data stored in the cloud, has to be
  stored within the United States or in specific jurisdictions. More information
  is available
  <a
    class="external_link"
    href="https://www.acquisition.gov/dfars/239.7602-2-required-storage-data-within-united-states-or-outlying-areas."
    >here</a
  >. Secure networks also prevent data from being hijacked in transit.
</p>

<p>
  Protections need to be in place to prevent unauthorized access. Of course, if
  there is any amount of sensitive information being used, the GenAI tools can
  only run on those systems that have the right protections and safeguards in
  place. But even with non-sensitive information, ensure that Federal data
  protection standards and regulations will be met. And because cyber
  threats are only getting worse, GenAI systems must have proper cybersecurity
  systems including threat detection and risk mitigation.
</p>

<h3>3.4.2 Inventory the data that goes in and out of the GenAI tool</h3>
<p>
  List the data that will be involved in the Generative AI tools the agency
  plans to use. There are four major types of data in Generative AI tools that
  should be managed.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    GenAI Training &amp; Testing Data - This is the information that the
    manufacturer of the GenAI tool used to create the LLM and see if it worked
    well.
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    Agency Inputted Data - This is the information that the agency staff feeds
    into the model so the LLM can summarize it, find patterns and insights or
    transform it.
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    GenAI Outputted Data - This is the information that the LLM creates based on
    the training, testing and agency inputted data.
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    Gen AI Model - This is the model itself (which isn’t really data as much as
    it is a set of algorithms and computer code).
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>3.4.3 Ask Questions to Understand the Data</h3>

<p>
  Here are a few starter questions to help the IPT get a better sense of the
  data the agency will be managing.
</p>

<h4>GenAI Training &amp; Testing Data</h4>
<ul>
  <li>How big is (was) the data set?</li>
  <li>
    What data was used (social media, news, legal documents, scientific reports,
    etc.)?
  </li>
  <li>
    What are the demographics associated with the data set?
    <ul>
      <li>
        Was the data generated by professionals (scientists, lawyers, others)?
      </li>
      <li>
        Is there a discernible geographic or age demographic with the
        data?
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    Have there been any studies on the data that may indicate prior use and
    intent?
  </li>
  <li>Are there any inherent biases in the data set?</li>
</ul>

<h4>Agency Inputted Data</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Who generated the data?</li>
  <li>What is its quality?</li>
  <li>
    What was the context in which the data set was gathered or generated or what
    was its initial intended purpose(s)?
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>GenAI Outputted Data</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Who owns the IP generated by AI tools (e.g. software code)?</li>
  <li>Who owns the data itself after it is generated/modified?</li>
  <li>Who owns the model once the contract ends?</li>
  <li>Will outputted data be used to train the GenAI model you are using?</li>
  <li>Could outputted data impact citizen entitlements, benefits or rights?</li>
  <li>
    Does the agency have the ability to assess, monitor and control outputs?
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>GenAI Model</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Will you be able to input your own data to get better results?</li>
  <li>Will agency data be used to train the GenAI model you are using?</li>
  <li>
    Does the model have any sort of history of bias or ethical challenges that
    have not been corrected?
  </li>
  <li>
    Could use of the model inadvertently synthesize sensitive or CUI information
    or information perceived to be sensitive or CUI?
  </li>
  <li>
    What kinds of protections or submodels are being formed with data that could
    inadvertently lead to adverse outcomes for government customers
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>3.4.4 Identify Potential Risks for Data</h3>
<p>
  This guide lists potential risks of GenAI in Section 1: Misinformation and
  Disinformation,
</p>
<p>
  AI Hallucinations, Bias and Discrimination, Prompt Manipulation, Regulatory
  and Legal Compliance, Security/Cybersecurity Risks, Privacy Risks,
  Intellectual Property and Plagiarism, Environmental Impact, Model Training
  Delay and Ownership.
</p>

<h4>Clarify ethical challenges.</h4>
<p>
  Documents like the
  <a
    class="external_link"
    href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ai-bill-of-rights/"
    >AI Bill of Rights</a
  >
  and the
  <a class="external_link" href="https://rai.tradewindai.com/"
    >Tradewinds Responsible AI Toolkit</a
  >
  and other published ethical frameworks can help in understanding what issues
  to prioritize.
</p>

<p>From the Responsible AI website:</p>

<p>
  “The Responsible Artificial Intelligence (RAI) Toolkit provides a centralized
  process that identifies, tracks, and improves alignment of AI projects to RAI
  best practices and the DoD AI Ethical Principles, while capitalizing on
  opportunities for innovation. The RAI Toolkit provides an intuitive flow
  guiding the user through tailorable and modular assessments, tools, and
  artifacts throughout the AI product lifecycle. The process enables
  traceability and assurance of responsible AI practice, development, and
  use.”
</p>

<h4>Complete a risk assessment.</h4>
<p>
  For each of the areas listed above, capture both what might go wrong and the
  potential harm, damage or loss that the agency would suffer if that happened.
</p>

<p>
  The Responsible AI Toolkit also had a guide on risk. “The Responsible
  Artificial Intelligence (RAI) Defense AI Guide on Risk (DAGR) is intended to
  provide DoD AI stakeholders with a voluntary guide to promote holistic risk
  captures and improved trustworthiness, effectiveness, responsibility, risk
  mitigation, and operations.” It is also a valuable resource for non-DoD
  agencies. For more information, please review:

    >FAR 34.004</a
  >
  defines the acquisition strategy as “the program manager’s overall plan for
  satisfying the mission needs in the most effective, economical, and timely
  manner.”
</p>
<p>
  With the IPT having tested GenAI solutions in sandboxes and defined how data
  will be managed, map out an acquisition strategy that looks at all the ways to
  get the right tools.
</p>
<p>
  A GenAI acquisition strategy should spell out what you intend to buy and how
  you intend to buy it. Specify the performance metrics of the Generative AI
  products, tools, functions, modules or add-ons that will best serve the agency
  based on the sandbox tests the IPT completed. There are multiple ways to
  answer the question of “how.”
</p>

<h3>3.5.1 The fastest acquisition may be no acquisition.</h3>
<p>
  Generative AI tools are often software delivered via the web or “Software as a
  Service” (SaaS). So most Generative AI tools are easily available through
  cloud platforms, other software packages and publicly-available
  websites.
</p>

<p>
  That means your agency might be able to access Generative AI solutions without
  doing a new acquisition.
</p>

<p>Here are a few options:</p>

<h4>3.5.1.1 From public web tools you can already access</h4>
<p>
  Many providers offer basic Generative AI tools and services from a freely
  available public page or a search page. If your agency staff’s Generative AI
  needs are basic, consider using one of these basic, free tools.
</p>

<h4>3.5.1.2 In software you already have</h4>
<p>
  Lots of software packages have basic Generative AI functionality built in.
  Before you start a new acquisition, check with your agency’s IT group. You may
  already have access to the right Generative AI tools within your existing
  software.
</p>

<h4>3.5.1.3 Via a cloud platform you already use</h4>
<p>
  Many of the major cloud platforms and “hyperscalers” provide access to
  Generative AI tools as modules from right within their platforms. Agency staff
  might be able to use their current cloud platform account and credits to pay
  for and use those modules.
</p>
<h5>Best Practices when Accessing GenAI Tools via a Cloud Platform</h5>
<ul>
  <li>
    Get formal risk management approval from the OCIO, CISO and CAIO. The EO
    stipulates AI use cases need to be risk managed by contract authorities or
    agency IT. If there is not yet a formalized process, document your approvals
    from the relevant agency officials.
  </li>
  <li>
    Identify which cloud platforms your agency has access to, which office(s)
    own the contracts and what the terms and conditions are. In many cases, the
    contract and contracting officer are assigned to the CIO organization.
  </li>
  <li>
    Prioritize security even for experiments. Choose cloud platforms and modules
    that have received FedRAMP authorizations. Understand how your data may be
    used to train the model or improve outputs, with and without your consent.
  </li>
  <li>
    Develop a cost estimate based on the pricing in the contract. If the
    contract is with a Value Added Reseller, there may be management costs for
    the vendor in addition to the credits needed to stand up the
    environment.
  </li>
  <li>
    Ensure you are getting access to the right version of the platforms.
    Many cloud platforms have different versions for commercial and
    government each with special security options and pricing models. You may
    also need to request permission to access GenAI modules if there are only
    test versions available for federal environments.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>3.5.1.4 From a system integrator already on contract</h4>
<p>
  A growing number of IT system integrators have built Generative AI tools and
  interfaces to others’ tools. Agency staff can sometimes access such tools
  through a custom portal or from software that the SIs have deployed. Depending
  on their contract and task order, an SI might already be able to provide or
  build a custom solution to provide access to Generative AI tools.
</p>

<p>
  Keep in mind that even though you might not do a new acquisition you may still
  need to modify the terms and conditions of an existing contract, obligate
  funds to buy more credits or upgrade subscriptions or exercise an option.
</p>

<h3>3.5.2 Acquisition Channels for GenAI</h3>
<p>
  If you need to do an acquisition to access GenAI tools a few options exist:
</p>

<h4>
  Acquire access to GenAI tools or functions within software you already
  have.
</h4>
<p>
  Typically the acquisition process for getting these GenAI features will look
  like paying more for a higher subscription or to move up to the next feature
  tier that has the more expensive functions. If you procure that software
  through a reseller there may be a management fee in addition to the cost of
  GenAI tools access.
</p>

<h4>Acquire access to GenAI tools directly from the manufacturer.</h4>
<p>
  The acquisition process will probably look like paying the manufacturer
  according to their pricing structures. The manufacturer may make use of
  resellers who may charge a management fee in addition to the cost of GenAI
  tools access.
</p>
<h4>
  Acquire access to a cloud platform and GenAI tools through that
  platform.
</h4>
<p>
  The acquisition process should involve procuring access to the cloud platform
  and then paying for using the GenAI tools. Many of the cloud platforms use
  resellers who may charge a management fee in addition to the cost of GenAI
  tools access.
</p>
<h4>Acquire access to GenAI tools through a system integrator.</h4>
<p>
  System integrators all have different pricing models but you can expect to
  find many that bill as professional services by the hour, week or month. They
  may charge separately for GenAI tools access.
</p>
<p>
  Many GenAI tool manufacturers use multiple channels for their products. They
  sell their tools directly, they use resellers and they make their tools
  available through cloud platforms and system integrators. Often the prices
  vary among the channels – in some cases you have to pay if you go to the
  manufacturer but you can get limited uses of products for free through
  partners.
</p>

<p>
  Look carefully at the different acquisition options and determine what best
  meets your agency’s needs. Identify which options offer…
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The trackable, transparent and cost-effective pricing models</li>
  <li>
    The flexibility and scalability for changing users, usage or use cases
  </li>
  <li>The terms and conditions for proper security and data management</li>
  <li>The ease for agency staff to access and use the tool</li>
  <li>The speed of acquiring access once the solicitation is released</li>
</ul>

<h3>3.6.1 Conduct Market Research</h3>
<p>
  The marketplace for Generative AI technologies and vendors is changing every
  day. Large GenAI companies, universities, small businesses and new upstarts
  are all announcing new tools, capabilities and features constantly. Generative
  AI is such a popular topic that there are multiple articles on these
  advancements every day. Stay informed about the latest AI technologies and
  vendors by monitoring tech and Federal IT news websites.
</p>

<p>
  It can still be difficult to know which resellers, vendors and manufacturers
  to look at for a particular acquisition. Those on government contracts are a
  good starting place. Search tools on acquisition program websites like
  <a class="external_link" href="https://gsaelibrary.gsa.gov/ElibMain/home.do"
    >GSA’s eLibrary</a
  >
  and
  <a class="external_link" href="https://cic.gsa.gov/"
    >Cloud Information Center</a
  >
  provide easy ways to find suppliers.
</p>

<p>
  The Federal Acquisition Service (FAS) also runs a free

    >Market Research as a Service (MRAS)</a
  >
  offering for agencies to craft targeted asks of industry that can then inform
  those agencies’ GenAI acquisitions.
</p>

<p>
  In addition, a data dashboard for obligations around generative AI can be
  found

    class="external_link"
    href="https://staging.d2d.gsa.gov/report/governmentwide-ai-eo-dashboard-0"
    >here</a
  >.
</p>

<h3>3.6.2. Look for FedRAMP authorization.</h3>
<p>
  As many Generative AI products are cloud based offerings complying with
  Federal security rules around cloud services is essential. Look for products
  which have received FedRAMP authorization.
</p>

<p>
  Products which have gone through the FedRAMP process have undergone a
  significant review of security documentation, testing and validation which can
  accelerate CIO approval for a product to be incorporated into an agency
  network. The
  <a class="external_link" href="https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/products"
    >FedRAMP Marketplace</a
  >
  is a searchable and sortable database of cloud service offerings that have
  achieved a FedRAMP designation
</p>

<p>
  FedRAMP also published a draft
  <a
    class="external_link"
    href="https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/FedRAMP_DRAFT_Emerging_Technology_Prioritization_Framework.pdf"
    >Emerging Technology Prioritization Framework</a
  >. This document describes the operational framework for how FedRAMP will
  prioritize certain cloud service offerings that utilize specific emerging
  technologies.
</p>

<p>
  The prioritization process will be integrated into existing and future FedRAMP
  authorization paths. The prioritization framework will not create additional
  authorization pathways and will maintain the same rigorous and thorough
  authorization requirements.
</p>

<h3>3.6.3 Do Multiple Layers of Diligence</h3>
<p>
  Acquisition professionals are used to conducting due diligence on suppliers.
  Generative AI is an emerging field with new players arising all the time.
  Knowing which vendors can deliver on their promised results is difficult and a
  big reason why it’s important to test solutions before acquiring them.
</p>
<h4>Vendor Due Diligence</h4>
<p>
  Standard due diligence on companies is still important. Looking at their track
  record as a government supplier, their financial health and their past
  performance are all good indications (but not guarantees) of how they might
  perform on an acquisition you run.
</p>
<p>
  At the same time, remember that this field is emerging. Some of the companies
  doing sophisticated and powerful work have been in business for less than 10
  years. Aside from the older, larger and established IT players, many of the
  Generative AI companies aren’t registered government suppliers yet.
</p>

<p>
  Because many Generative AI solutions may be accessed through a cloud provider,
  a partner, a systems integrator or a reseller, you may need to do some extra
  work to understand both the vendor’s and manufacturer’s ability to deliver.
  Ask about what access the team may have to the Generative AI tool manufacturer
  even through the contract may be with another entity.
</p>

<h4>Model and Data Diligence</h4>
<p>
  Generative AI applications are built on training data. Understanding the data,
  its biases and its current applications and usage will help to identify
  whether a particular application or model is more appropriate to meet needs.
</p>

<p>
  The CAIO of the agency is responsible for ensuring that Generative AI systems
  comply with relevant standards. Acquisition staff can assist by documenting
  their process and decisions.
</p>

<p>
  Asking suppliers to share information about their products helps acquisition
  staff know that there is transparency and accountability in the procurement.
  At the same time, it helps the IPT and CAIO jointly monitor compliance
  later.
</p>

<p>Specific questions to ask include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What data was the model trained on and tested on?</li>
  <li>When was the last time the model was updated and what was changed?</li>
  <li>What kinds of outputs does the system filter out?</li>
  <li>How have other users’ data been incorporated back into the model?</li>
  <li>Who owns the outputs from the tool?</li>
</ul>

<p>
  One example of a “declaration form” for a GenAI tool was created by the GovAI
  Coalition, a group of public servants from over 150 local, county, and state
  governments. Their form is available
  <a
    class="external_link"
    href="https://www.sanjoseca.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/109730/638458752830000000"
    >here</a
  >.
</p>
<p>
  <br />
  
</p>
<h2><a id="3.7" name="3.7">3.7 Estimate Costs.</a></h2>

<p>
  Costs for generative AI tools can add up quickly. Understand your agency’s
  users, use cases, desired outcomes and internal policies to develop accurate
  estimates.
</p>

<h3>3.7.1 Generative AI tools are sold like software.</h3>
<p>
  Again, most commercial Generative AI tools are considered “software” so they
  tend to be sold the way most software is sold and priced nowadays. Agencies
  pay fees for software in three main ways: subscriptions, usage and feature
  tiers.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <h4>Subscriptions</h4>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Agency pays per month or year for each account that renews at the end of the
  term until canceled, regardless of how much you use the model. Think of this
  like the fee you might pay for a video streaming service: you can watch as
  much as you want for a flat fee per month or per year.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <h4>Usage</h4>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Agency pays per the amount of data inputted or outputted, the time or
  resources used on a particular platform or the quality of output. Think of
  this like the fee you might pay for a rideshare: you pay for the length of the
  trip, the time the trip takes and a little more if a lot of people are trying
  to get rides at the same time.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <h4>Feature Tiers</h4>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Agency pays once per the group of functions and features regardless of
  consumption/usage or number of users. Think of this like the one-time fee you
  might pay for a membership: you pay one fee to the club which entitles you to
  lifetime benefits and if you pay a higher fee you get more benefits like
  access to exclusive sales.
</p>

<p>
  Generative AI tools typically charge some combination of these fees. Here are
  a few examples based on real life cases:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    A reseller charges an agency $20 per month per user for email, word
    processing, spreadsheets and presentations programs and apps. They charge an
    additional $20 per month for Generative AI features and functions in these
    same programs and apps.
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    A company offers the ability to “train” an AI model charges an agency a base
    rate per month for an account plus a $10 per million credits or tokens where
    each token represents an individual word of “training data” that the agency
    uploads.
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    A cloud platform provider charges a certain amount to get access to a
    Generative AI model but then charges the agency for every minute they use
    the model or for every time they access a database that the model connects
    to.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>3.7.2 Estimating the Costs of Generative AI Solutions</h3>

<p>
  To estimate the costs of Generative AI solutions, start by understanding the
  fees that the supplier would charge then ask questions to quantify accounts,
  users, time and usage.
</p>

<h3>3.7.3 Developing estimates for using Generative AI tools</h3>
<p>
  Subscription pricing generally is straightforward: estimate the number of
  users and the costs. As Generative AI tools are new and companies are still
  figuring out their own costs and revenues these rates may change, these costs
  may change. Though you should always try to negotiate for discounts from
  listed prices, companies are rarely offering reduced prices for tools at this
  time so listed prices are realistic for estimating purposes.
</p>

<p>
  When accessing generative AI tools through a usage based model, account for
  any type of access costs in addition to actual usage. For example, if you are
  accessing a generative AI tool through your Cloud provider’s architecture and
  you use a Value Added Reseller (VAR) for that architecture, your estimate will
  need to include any costs the VAR charges in addition to your usage costs. It
  is also important to understand and account for any additional access charges
  your Cloud provider may add on top of their usage costs and the usage costs
  for the particular generative AI tool.
</p>

<p>
  Similar to subscription pricing, estimating costs for software feature tiers
  is generally straightforward but offerings within tiers and pricing may change
  more frequently as companies develop and integrate generative AI models and
  capabilities into their products.
</p>

<p>
  Four of the largest Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) provide cost calculators to
  assist in estimating a budget and developing a cost estimate. Other CSPs may
  provide similar tools and serve as a basis for your estimate. Successfully
  using these tools requires the estimator to have knowledge of the potential
  workload and types, processing speeds and memory needed as well as the number
  of users. Consult with technical experts in your organization and use more
  than one of the tools when building your estimate.
</p>

<p>
  Setting up an agency “test bed” or “sandbox” for a particular generative AI
  model and constructing an experiment is one way to understand and estimate
  potential usage costs.
</p>

<p>
  When constructing technical architectures the IPT will have visibility and
  options on which components it chooses to use and the associated costs with
  each particular component. Ensuring CORs and end users communicate often
  during the development process and operations of the tools will help manage
  your spend.
</p>

<p>
  An overview on pricing for general Cloud services can be found at the Cloud
  Information Center: https://cic.gsa.gov/acquisitions/pricing
</p>

<p>
  Agencies may find they need to contract for specific services to develop, tune
  and maintain their models. Contracting officers should reach out to their
  CAIO’s office to identify the most relevant labor categories or skill sets for
  the particular requirements if this is needed. Use tools such as GSA’s
  <a class="external_link" href="https://buy.gsa.gov/pricing/">CALC</a> to help
  develop estimates if you have an understanding of appropriate labor categories
  and skill levels.
</p>

<h2><a id="3.8" name="3.8">3.8 Monitor and Evaluate.</a></h2>

<p>
  Generative AI tools are constantly learning and changing. Once a tool is
  implemented, the IPT must closely monitor how it is used and the
  outputs.
</p>

<h3>3.8.1 Maintain the IPT</h3>
<p>
  The Generative AI IPT should continue to function for the full lifecycle of
  using the tool.
</p>

<h4>Training</h4>
<p>
  The IPT should develop appropriate training materials and deliver them to the
  end users. Part of this training should identify the changing nature of
  generative AI tools to help identify if the product is not functioning
  correctly.
</p>

<h4>Incident Detection and Response</h4>
<p>
  Build in reporting and redress procedures for when something goes wrong. This
  is particularly important when Generative AI tools and their outputs may be
  used in a manner impacting benefits, rights or norms. Use robust bias
  detection and mitigation strategies to stay ahead of problems. Establish audit
  and oversight mechanisms to flag when incidents occur and when model
  performance is degrading. This will help identify when models may need to be
  refreshed, modified, or taken out of production.
</p>

<h4>Strategic Objectives</h4>
<p>
  Most importantly, regularly review and adjust your AI strategies to ensure
  they remain effective and aligned with your agency’s goals.
</p>

<h3>3.8.2 Engage regularly with vendors</h3>
<p>
  The inputs and outputs of Generative AI tools may change the functionality and
  performance of the product. Successfully managing a Generative AI acquisition
  requires frequent communication with vendors.
</p>

<h4>Meeting Performance and Ethical Standards</h4>
<p>
  Before contract award, meet with the vendors to clearly define how they will
  both meet performance and ethical standards and mitigate risks associated with
  the tool. Clarify the roles and responsibilities of vendors, particularly if a
  use case has an impact on citizen rights, entitlements or other benefit
  programs.
</p>

<h4>Resolving Disputes</h4>
<p>
  Agree on areas of uncertainty that exist with the generative AI tool and how
  to adjudicate any disputes between the government and the vendor providing the
  model. Document these agreements and identify a cadence to review and update
  them.
</p>

<h4>Updating Products</h4>
<p>
  Identify procedures to measure and support trust and assurance for products.
  This should include testing and system update cycles. Consider doing this
  through an SLA or other mechanism which the IPT can use to monitor vendor
  performance.
</p>

<h4>Protecting Legal Rights</h4>
<p>
  Where systems may support decisions on rights impacting programs make sure the
  models can be contested in accordance with the laws, statues and regulations
  governing the program.
</p>

<h4>Controlling Expenses and Costs</h4>
<p>
  Monitor costs against the cost estimates you created during the acquisition.
  Make sure invoices contain sufficient detail to monitor and control
  expenditures, particularly usage or consumption costs. Regularly communicate
  with end users and the technical team, and review invoices to make sure they
  are in alignment with how the Generative AI tools are being used.
</p>

<h1 id="chapter4">4. Acquisition Methods and Vehicles</h1>
<p>
  There is currently not a governmentwide Generative AI-only acquisition
  vehicle. That said, the federal government has a variety of procurement
  options to help agencies purchase Generative AI solutions.
</p>

<p>
  An agency may have its own specific Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) that
  permits them to procure Generative AI solutions. If such a BPA exists for your
  agency, consider using it.
</p>

<p>
  Below is a list of some procurement options that you may wish to consider as
  you are planning your acquisition. When it comes time to buy Generative AI
  solutions, look at governmentwide Best-in-Class (BIC) acquisition vehicles as
  opportunities for best pricing and terms and conditions.
</p>

<p>
  While open market buys of Generative AI are possible and many agencies have
  done them, they bring great risks from financial to compliance. It is
  generally more prudent to use governmentwide contracts that mitigate risks and
  leverage the government’s buying power.

<h2>GSA Multiple Award Schedules (MAS) IT</h2>
<p>
  The Multiple Award Schedules (MAS) IT (what used to be called “Schedule 70”)
  provides easy ways to purchase over 7.5 million innovative commercial
  products, services, and solutions from thousands of pre-qualified vendors,
  including ones offering Generative AI solutions. MAS IT is managed by General
  Services Administration (GSA).
</p>

<p>
  Because MAS IT has a large vendor base it is best for commercial items and/or
  if you need to meet socioeconomic small business goals. MAS IT vendors have
  also gone through an initial series of compliance checks and pre-negotiated
  pricing reducing the workload on agency contracting officials. If you have a
  well-defined requirement and market research indicates that a commercial
  Generative AI tool can fulfill your need, the MAS IT vehicle may be a good fit
  for your procurement. For more information, please review:

<h2>Tradewinds</h2>
<p>
  Tradewinds is the Department of Defense’s Platform for learning about and
  procuring technology; it offers “AcqBot” (a Generative AI enabled chatbot) and
  a Solutions Marketplace to support AI procurements. Tradewinds has several
  contract vehicles that can be utilized for procurement, including TryAI
  Commercial Solutions Opening (CSO), Test and Evaluation Services Blanket
  Purchase Agreement (BPA), Data Readiness for Artificial Intelligence
  Development (DRAID) BOA, and AI Talent. Tradewinds is particularly
  useful for agencies intending to quickly procure and test commercial AI
  solutions, acquire demonstrations of innovative commercial items, or seek AI
  talent. For more information, please review:
  <a class="external_link" href="https://www.tradewindai.com/">Link</a>.
</p>

<h2>Cooperative Research and Development Agreements</h2>
<p>
  A Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) authorizes federal
  labs to enter into agreements with other federal agencies, state/local
  government, industry, non-profits, and universities for licensing agreements
  for lab developed inventions or intellectual property to commercialize
  products or processes originating in federal labs. This approach may be most
  suitable if a government lab and their commercial partners either are
  developing or have developed a Generative AI tool that fits the needs of your
  agency. While no government funds can directly be provided under this
  approach, collaborating with private sector entities can provide access to
  cutting-edge Generative AI technologies and expertise, offering a path to
  innovative solutions. For more information, please review
  <a
    class="external_link"
    href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=29&amp;f=treesort&amp;num=1958"
    >15 USC 3710a: Cooperative research and development agreements</a
  >.
</p>

<h2>Interagency Agreement</h2>
<p>
  Interagency agreements are authorized by the Economy Act, which allows
  agencies to enter into agreements to obtain supplies or services from another
  agency. This approach may be most practical for situations where another
  agency already has a Generative AI solution or solution set which meets your
  needs and has the ability for additional agencies to use that solution.
  For more information, please review

    >31 U.S.C.1535: Agency Agreements</a
  >.
</p>
<h2>Other Transaction Authority (OTA)</h2>
<p>
  Some agencies have the authority to enter into a non-FAR based legal agreement
  called an Other Transaction Authority (OTA) that leverages commercial buying
  practices. Typically OTAs are utilized to procure state-of-the-art technology
  solutions from non-traditional vendors. OTAs can be used for research and
  development activities, prototyping, and in certain cases production of
  prototypes. For Generative AI solutions, this may be a good solution to help a
  non-traditional vendor modify a commercial product to government
  specifications, reach smaller or niche companies with specific generative AI
  expertise, or more quickly develop an agency specific Generative AI
  capability. Your agency must have specific statutory authority to use OTA
  arrangements.
</p>

<h2>Commercial Solutions Opening (CSO)</h2>
<p>
  CSOs are similar to Broad Agency Announcements (BAAs) which are used for
  Research and Development (R&amp;D); however, CSOs are set up for innovative
  commercial solutions. Typically a phased acquisition approach is used where a
  problem statement is provided by the government through a Statement of
  Objectives (SOO) and vendors submit white papers on their approach to solve
  the problem. After a technical evaluation and based on funding requirements,
  prototypes and simulations are funded and potentially follow-on contracts.
  Consider using a CSO to generate new ideas and concepts and obtain an
  innovative solution using generative AI when shorter evaluation timelines and
  rapid selection of innovative commercial solutions are necessary and when
  proposals with varying technical/scientific approaches are anticipated.
</p>

<h2>Prize Competitions</h2>
<p>
  One way that agencies can begin to explore harnessing Generative AI is through
  prize based competitions.
  <a class="external_link" href="http://challenge.gov">Challenge.gov</a> is a
  central hub for prize competitions across the U.S. federal government. Through
  this platform and others, federal agencies can engage public solvers in prize
  competitions and crowdsourcing campaigns to identify innovative solutions to
  important issues. A prize competition may be appropriate if you are hoping to
  engage a diverse set of solvers, and if you would prefer to reward research
  outcomes rather than fund research inputs. You may wish to consider using a
  Prize Competition if you can:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>clearly explain the problem to be solved,</li>
  <li>outline the parameters of a successful outcome, and</li>
  <li>determine how to measure the submissions and declare a winner.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="chapter5">5. Data Tools</h1>

<p>
  The AI Executive Order directs agencies to promote transparency and encourage
  data-informed decision making, so we’ve prepared a dataset and dashboard to
  explore the current state of Federal AI procurement. Taken together, these
  tools constitute a functioning repository to search for current contracts with
  AI/ML scope across the Federal Government.
</p>
<h2>AI Procurement Dataset</h2>
<p>
  This dataset of around 10K transactions provides a comprehensive analysis of
  AI-related contract actions in the U.S. federal civilian government from
  Fiscal Years 2019-2023. This dataset, derived from over 30 million contract
  actions drawn from the Federal Procurement Data System, is structured to spot
  trends, patterns, and key players in federal AI acquisitions. In line with AI
  Executive Order 14110, AI-PD is poised to aid the acquisition workforce in
  making data-driven decisions when they go to procure AI and specialized
  computing infrastructure.

<h1 id="chapter6">6.0 Specialized Computing Infrastructure for Generative AI</h1>
<h2>6.1 Specialized Computing Infrastructure for GenAI 101</h2>
<p>
  Generative AI tools, like all software, run on computers. Because GenAI tools
  are so calculations-heavy, they require computers that are larger, more
  sophisticated and more powerful. These computers can look like the massive
  “supercomputers” like the ones located at government national laboratories.
  They can also look like very powerful “server” computers that sit as small
  clusters in an agency’s IT center or as groups of hundreds of servers sitting
  in large data centers.
</p>
<p>
  If your agency is accessing Generative AI tools through a cloud-based
  platform, you won’t really have to worry too much about the computing power.
  But if your agency is attempting to create its own models and needs its own
  dedicated computers, or has security needs that require the agency to own and
  operate its own computers, it may be necessary to setup its own specialized
  computing infrastructure for GenAI.
</p>

<h3>6.1.1 Specialized Computing Infrastructure Overview</h3>
<p>
  Specialized Computing Infrastructure can be thought of as the high-performance
  computers, powerful chips, software, networks and resources made specifically
  for building, training, fine-tuning, testing, using and maintaining artificial
  intelligence applications. Computing infrastructure can be on-premise, cloud
  based or a combination of both.
</p>

<p>Specialized Computing Infrastructure tends to have…</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Advanced Computer Chips that can run multiple, complex calculations
    simultaneously and coordinate multiple functions at once.
  </li>
  <li>
    Scalable Processing Power giving the ability to quickly access additional
    chips if even more computational power is needed.
  </li>
  <li>
    Enhanced Data Storage and Memory to save, access and manage large sets of
    information.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fast Networking to transfer data at high-speeds among systems with minimal
    errors and little delay or “latency.”
  </li>
  <li>
    Sophisticated Software Tools that engineers can use to write computer code,
    program algorithms and adjust models.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>6.1.2 Chips and Computers for Generative AI</h3>
<p>
  The computer chips that Generative AI models rely on to run calculations are
  powerful and expensive with individual chips running sometimes more than $100K
  apiece. Only a few companies design them and only a few companies actually
  manufacture them.
</p>
<p>
  Businesses looking to increase their specialized computing infrastructure are
  spending millions on the chips and computers that they can use to run their
  own Generative AI applications.
</p>

<p>
  Computer makers have started releasing AI chips-enable servers, workstation
  PCs, desktops and laptops. The hardware is optimized with specialized GPU
  chips and larger amounts of RAM to run models directly on the platform without
  having to send the queries to a data center or through a Cloud provider.
</p>

<p>
  These computers may be a good fit for Generative AI tools that run off of
  smaller models or smaller data sets.
</p>

<h2>6.2 Government Specialized Computing Infrastructure for Generative AI</h2>
<p>
  In addition to the above, government specialized computing infrastructure for
  GenAI also needs to have the right security protocols, integration with
  existing systems and energy efficiency. The Federal government has assembled
  and deployed several specific examples of dedicated specialized computing
  infrastructure. Here are a few examples of existing federal specialized
  computing infrastructures supporting Generative AI research and model
  development:
</p>

<h4>Department of Energy’s Supercomputers</h4>
<p>
  These cutting-edge powerhouses were originally designed and used for
  simulations and research in energy, nuclear capabilities, and climate
  modeling. DOE has made significant investments in expanding these systems over
  the last few years adding in the chips, networks and other components needed
  to drive making, training and using Generative AI applications. DOE’s systems
  now include “Discovery Zone” which are sandboxes to test Generative AI
  technology. Recently it began work on a new supercomputer that they hope will
  be focused more on GenAI and other AI work.
</p>

<h4>NSF National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource Pilot</h4>
<p>
  The NAIRR pilot brings together computational, data, software, model, training
  and user support resources to demonstrate and investigate multiple facets of
  artificial intelligence including Generative AI. Led by the U.S. National
  Science Foundation (NSF) in partnership with 10 other federal agencies and 25
  non-governmental partners, the pilot brings together resources like “compute”
  credits on various platforms, datasets that scientists and engineers can use
  and large language models (LLMs) that have been trained and fine-tuned for
  specific purposes. NAIRR will be available to support the nation’s research
  and education community.
</p>

<p>
  Many more agencies including NASA and Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
  are developing their own specialized computing infrastructure to support GenAI
  experiments. In lots of those cases, they are accessing GenAI tools and
  creating sandboxes in commercial cloud platforms.
</p>

<p>
  The CHIPS Act provided funding for grants and subsidies to research, develop,
  and produce high quality microchips and semiconductors in the United States.
  This includes potential investments in companies designing and producing chips
  specifically tuned to run Generative AI models. The program is managed by the
  Department of Commerce. More information can be found
  <a class="external_link" href="https://www.nist.gov/chips">here</a>. This will
  eventually increase competition and make it easier to comply with many of the
  statutory and regulatory provisions around country of origin. Department of
  Defense recently announced a $3.5B grant to Intel to make custom AI chips for
  the armed forces and is investigating whether funding will now come from the
  CHIPS Act.
</p>

<h2>6.3 Assess your specialized computing infrastructure needs</h2>

<p>
  Building specialized computing infrastructure for Generative AI can be a
  longer term undertaking, and involves a significant amount of up front
  investing before delivering results. Do a thorough assessment of the
  organizations’ needs to be served by generative AL for the long term. Consider
  several items:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Technical Infrastructure Needs: Determine the level of specialized computing
    infrastructure necessary to support your Generative AI initiatives,
    including processing power and data storage capabilities.
  </li>
  <li>
    Partnerships: Explore partnerships with cloud providers or specialized
    vendors who can offer the necessary infrastructure and expertise.
  </li>
  <li>
    Compliance: Ensure that any infrastructure procurement complies with federal
    acquisition regulations and cybersecurity standards.
  </li>
  <li>
    Organizational Capabilities: Determine whether your organization has the
    skills and capabilities to develop, test and control models.
  </li>
  <li>
    Security: Identify where and how cloud infrastructure will be used to
    operate models once built. Also understand where data will reside and how it
    is protected in transit.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>
  6.4 Estimating costs for specialized computing infrastructure for Generative
  AI
</h2>

<p>
  It’s conceivable that a civilian agency would want to get servers enabled with
  AI chips to be able to run focused tests. A few agencies with more specific
  needs and demands may need to invest more heavily in its own specialized
  computing infrastructure for Generative AI. Specialized computing
  infrastructure for generative AI is similar to other high performance
  computing environments in many respects.
</p>
<p>
  The most critical decision in determining cost categories is to determine
  whether the infrastructure project would be more “software” or “hardware” –
  meaning, would it use dedicated cloud-based processing or have multiple
  dedicated servers with AI chips and the associated storage, network and
  software physically on premises in a government owned or operated data center.
</p>

<h3>6.4.1 Initial questions to ask that will help estimate costs</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Will your Specialized Computing Infrastructure for generative AI be internal
    facing or public facing? The more potential users, data storage needs and
    traffic, the greater the costs.
  </li>
  <li>
    Will your infrastructure be developed, modified, or does it already exist?
    Facilities can be expanded or modified; brand new construction or major
    renovation will add to the costs.
  </li>
  <li>
    Who will own, maintain and be responsible for the infrastructure?
    Maintenance teams, physical security, supplies and additional discrete
    operating costs add to the overhead.
  </li>
  <li>
    Where will your infrastructure be located (physically and virtually)? If an
    agency doesn’t have the expertise, land and budget to build the facilities a
    Cloud based approach may be more in line with the longer term vision for the
    infrastructure.
  </li>
  <li>
    How will your data be accessed and from where? Individuals accessing and
    working with Generative AI tech from different locations will drive up
    ancillary hardware, software, networking and security costs.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>6.4.2 Common Cost Categories</h3>
<p>
  Contracting officials should closely consult with their technical and program
  counterparts to identify and understand the requirements as well as key cost
  drivers for Generative AI-specialized computing infrastructure acquisitions.
  Some common cost categories applicable to specialized computing infrastructure

</p>
<h2>
  6.5 Compliance when acquiring specialized computing infrastructure for
  Generative AI
</h2>

<p>
  When acquiring specialized computing infrastructure for Generative AI
  applications, federal agencies must navigate a unique set of considerations
  beyond standard procurement practices. Adherence to executive orders, federal
  regulations and policies ensures that Gen AI infrastructure aligns with
  national security interests, data protection laws and ethical standards.
</p>

<p>
  Technical leaders, CIOs, CISOs and other senior leaders and executives are
  responsible for ensuring agency networks and infrastructure are in compliance.
  High level overviews of these responsibilities can be found in the
  <a class="external_link" href="https://www.cio.gov/cio-handbook/"
    >CIO Handbook</a
  >
  and the
  <a
    class="external_link"
    href="https://www.cio.gov/assets/resources/CISO_Handbook.pdf"
    >CISO Handbook</a
  >.
</p>

<p>
  Acquisition professionals also need to be aware of rules and policies related
  to cybersecurity and supply chain management when purchasing specialized
  computing infrastructure. A few recent ones include:
</p>

<h4>Section 889</h4>
<p>
  FAR Modifications to Part 4.2102(a)(2) implemented Section 889 of the FY19
  National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). This clause prohibits purchase of
  certain networking and telecommunications equipment. Networking and telecom
  equipment is essential to any specialized computing infrastructure. Any agency
  looking to purchase specialized computing infrastructure to support Generative
  AI should ensure that they avoid these prohibited products. More info can be
  found
  <a
    class="external_link"
    href="https://www.acquisition.gov/Section-889-Policies"
    >here</a
  >.
</p>

<h4>Section 5949</h4>
<p>
  In 2022, the FY23 NDAA was signed into law. Section 5949 includes prohibitions
  on purchasing or renewing certain Semiconductor Products and Services. With
  advanced AI chips, GPUs and other semiconductors at the heart of any GenAI
  specialized computing infrastructure, understanding where such components are
  made is critical for any such acquisition. A FAR case is pending, but the
  statutory language is available
  <a
    class="external_link"
    href="https://www.congress.gov/committee-print/118th-congress/joint-committee-print/50665"
    >here</a
  >.
</p>

<h4>Trade Agreements Act (TAA)</h4>
<p>
  To be TAA compliant, all products sold to the government must be manufactured
  or “substantially transformed” in the United States or a TAA “designated
  country”.
  <a class="external_link" href="https://www.acquisition.gov/far/52.225-5"
    >FAR Part 52.225-5</a

  contains the appropriate contract clause and list of designated
  countries.
</p>

<p>DFARS 239.7602-2</p>
<p>
  Given the sensitive nature of data used in AI applications, considerations
  around data storage and processing locations are paramount. As noted in other
  sections, Federal regulations require that data be stored within the United
  States or in specific jurisdictions to comply with security and privacy
  standards. More information is available
  <a
