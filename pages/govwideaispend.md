<p>
  The AI Executive Order (E.O) directs agencies to promote transparency and encourage
  data-informed decision making, so we've prepared a dataset and dashboard to
  help you explore the current state of Federal AI procurement.
</p>
<h1>AI Procurement Dataset</h1>
<p>
  We queried the <a href="https://www.fpds.gov/" title="Federal Procurement Data System" target="_blank" class="external-link">Federal Procurement Data System</a>
  to prepare a comprehensive analysis of GenAI-related contract actions from
  2019 to 2023. It's designed to aid the acquisition workforce in
  making data-driven decisions when they go to procure AI and specialized
  computing infrastructure.

<h1>AI Procurement Dashboard</h1>
<p>
  This is an interactive Tableau dashboard designed to bring the AI Procurement
  Dataset to life. It enables government employees to visualize and analyze the
  landscape of federal AI acquisitions, fostering insights into market dynamics,
  spending patterns, and acquisition strategies. It's designed to equip you with actionable intelligence to guide strategic AI
  procurement and align with the E.O.'s instructions to facilitate responsible AI use
  across government organizations.
</p>
<p>Note: At the moment, only GSA employees can access the dashboard in its staging environment.</p>
