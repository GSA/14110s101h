<h1>AI Procurement Dataset</h1>
<p>This dataset provides a comprehensive analysis of AI-related contract actions in the U.S. federal civilian government from Fiscal Years 2019-2023. This dataset, derived from over 30 million contract actions drawn from the Federal Procurement Data System, is structured to spot trends, patterns, and key players in federal AI acquisitions. In line with AI Executive Order 14110, AI-PD is poised to aid the acquisition workforce in making data-driven decisions when they go to procure AI and specialized computing infrastructure.</p>
<h1>AI Procurement Dashboard</h1>
<p>This is an interactive Tableau dashboard designed to bring the AI Procurement Dataset to life. It enables government employees to visualize and analyze the landscape of federal AI acquisitions, fostering insights into market dynamics, spending patterns, and acquisition strategies. Consistent with the AI Executive Order 14110â€™s directives, the dashboard empowers the federal acquisition community with actionable intelligence to guide strategic AI procurement and align with GSA's efforts to facilitate responsible AI use across government organizations.</p>
