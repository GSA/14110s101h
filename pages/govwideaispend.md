<p>We are developing a dataset and dashboard in alignment with the AI Executive Order's directive to promote transparency and encourage informed AI procurement strategies in the federal government.</p>
<h1>AI Procurement Dataset</h1>
<p>The AI Procurement Dataset (AI-PD) provides a comprehensive analysis of AI-related contract actions in the U.S. federal civilian government from Fiscal Years 2019-2023. This dataset, derived from over 30 million contract actions drawn from the Federal Procurement Data System, is structured to spot trends, patterns, and key players in federal AI acquisitions. In line with AI Executive Order 14110, AI-PD is poised to aid the acquisition workforce in making data-driven decisions when they go to procure AI and specialized computing infrastructure.</p>

<h1>AI Procurement Explorer</h1>
<p>Dashboard Description:</p>
<p>The AI Procurement Explorer (AI-PE) is an interactive Tableau dashboard designed to bring the AI Procurement Dataset to life. It enables government employees to visualize and analyze the landscape of federal AI acquisitions, fostering insights into market dynamics, spending patterns, and acquisition strategies. Consistent with the AI Executive Order 14110â€™s directives, the AI-PE empowers the federal acquisition community with actionable intelligence to guide strategic AI procurement and align with GSA's efforts to facilitate responsible AI use across government organizations.</p>
<p>Both the dataset and dashboard are envisioned to act as critical tools in aligning AI acquisition strategies with federal policies and market realities, thereby enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of AI integration in government services.</p>
