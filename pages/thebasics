The AI Guide for Government on the GSA website outlines several practices to enhance the success of acquiring commercial AI products or services:

1. Statement of Objectives (SOO) and Performance Work Statement (PWS): Use SOO for innovative approaches and PWS for clear specifications. PWS empowers contractors to use best practices and their own innovative ideas to achieve desired results.

2. Technical Tests as Evaluation Criteria: Incorporate technical tests in solicitations, allowing technical experts to assess the applicability of proposed solutions.

3. Data Rights and Intellectual Property: Include deliverables like product backlogs, open-source repositories, and source code to create agnostic solutions. Ensure government usage rights to balance private-sector concerns.

4. Retrospectives on Acquisition Process: Document key clauses and language that worked or caused issues for both solicitation and post-award management. Share lessons learned for team efficiency.

5. Sharing Experiences: Encourage sharing results with federal colleagues and joining the Federal AI Community of Practice for collaborative learning and improvement​​.
