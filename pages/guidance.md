# This is the Federal Acquiring AI Resource Guide

v1.0 - December 2023

### Tips to help the acquisition workforce procure artificial intelligence solutions.

## Remember:

Generative AI tools use data and info you input to create new text, pictures and other media content. DO NOT upload classified, sensitive or controlled unclassified information to any Generative AI tool. When in doubt, consult your agency.

## Ready to AI?

### Your agency might be able to access Generative AI solutions without doing an acquisition. Here are a few ways to do that. As always, check with your agency before using any AI product or service.

**1. From public web tools**
Many AI providers offer basic AI tools and services from a freely available public page or a search page. If your agency staff’s Generative AI needs are basic, consider using one of these basic, free tools.

**2. In software you already have**
Lots of software packages have basic AI functionality built in. Before you start a new acquisition, check with your agency’s IT group. You may already have access to the right AI tools within your existing software.

**3. In a cloud platform you can access**
Many of the major cloud platforms and “hyperscalers” provide access to Generative AI tools as modules from right within their platforms. Agency staff might be able to use their current cloud platform account and credits to pay for and use those modules.

**4. From a system integrator on contract**
A growing number of IT system integrators have built Generative AI tools and interfaces to others’ tools. Agency staff can sometimes access such tools through a custom portal or from software that the SIs have deployed. Depending on their contract and task order, an SI might already be able to provide or build a custom solution to provide access to Generative AI tools.

**5. Built from scratch**

### You may need to do an acquisition for Generative AI products, services and solutions to support your agencies’ mission. Here a few ways to acquire Generative AI.

- As an Add-On to Existing Software
- As a Module or Service Through a Cloud Platform
- As a Service or Custom Software from a System Integrator
- As a Standalone Service Directly from a Registered Supplier
- As a Standalone Service Through a Reseller

# Background

### Executive Order 14110 directed GSA to facilitate agencies’ access to commercial AI capabilities. 

> **Section 10.1(h)**
>   
>> Within 180 days of the date of this order, to facilitate agencies’ access to commercial AI capabilities, the Administrator of General Services, in coordination with the Director of OMB, and in collaboration with the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Director of National Intelligence, the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the head of any other agency identified by the Administrator of General Services, shall take steps consistent with applicable law to facilitate access to Federal Government-wide acquisition solutions for specified types of AI services and products, such as through the creation of a resource guide or other tools to assist the acquisition workforce.  Specified types of AI capabilities shall include generative AI and specialized computing infrastructure.

## Definitions of Generative AI

### The AI Executive Order defines Generative AI as:

>“the class of AI models that emulate the structure and characteristics of input data in order to generate derived synthetic content.  This can include images, videos, audio, text, and other digital content.”

### The AI Executive Order defines Generative AI as: 

>“technology that can create content, including text, images, audio, or video, when prompted by a user. Generative AI systems create responses using algorithms that are trained often on open-source information, such as text and images from the internet. However, generative AI systems are not cognitive and lack human judgment.”
