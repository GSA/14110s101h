  <h1>Federal Procurement Guidance for Generative AI and Specialized Computing Infrastructure</h1>
  
<h2>Executive Order 14110
  </h2>
  <p>Executive Order 14110 Section 10.1(h) directed GSA to facilitate agencies’ access to commercial AI capabilities.
  </p>
  <p>“Within 180 days of the date of this order, to facilitate agencies’ access to commercial AI capabilities, the Administrator of General Services, in coordination with the Director of OMB, and in collaboration with the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Director of National Intelligence, the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the head of any other agency identified by the Administrator of General Services, shall take steps consistent with applicable law to facilitate access to Federal Government-wide acquisition solutions for specified types of AI services and products, such as through the creation of a resource guide or other tools to assist the acquisition workforce. Specified types of AI capabilities shall include generative AI and specialized computing infrastructure.”
  </p>
  <h3>Assisting the Acquisition Workforce
  </h3>
  <p>This guide is primarily meant for government purchasers and acquisition professionals navigating the complexities of acquiring AI technologies.
  </p>
  <p>AI can be very difficult to understand especially for someone who isn’t a technologist.
  </p>
  <p>As an acquisition professional, it is critical for you to work with both technical subject matter experts (SMEs) and program staff who can speak to their own needs and goals.
  </p>
  <p>While those in the acquisition community probably don’t need to become experts in AI, a basic understanding of certain AI terms will help you make better decisions about what to buy and how.
  </p>
  <p>To help, this guide also attempts to simplify complex technical IT and AI concepts to make them easier for non-technologists to understand. In some cases, this guide may over-simplify for the sake of clarity; apologies for any problems this causes.
  </p>
  <h3>This is Version 1.0
  </h3>
  <p>This guide isn’t static. It’s meant to evolve as technology advances while aligning with the Executive Order on AI, the OMB directive, federal laws, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), the NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF), and the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights.
  </p>
  <p>It’s designed with flexibility, housed in an HTML structure on GSA’s GitHub to facilitate collaboration and continuous improvement.

  <h2 id="chapter1">1. Generative AI 101</h2>
 <h3>Artificial Intelligence
  </h3>
  <p>15 U.S.C. 9401(3) defines “Artificial Intelligence” as:
  </p>
  <p>“a machine-based system that can, for a given set of human-defined objectives, make predictions, recommendations, or decisions influencing real or virtual environments. Artificial intelligence systems use machine- and human-based inputs to perceive real and virtual environments; abstract such perceptions into models through analysis in an automated manner; and use model inference to formulate options for information or action.”
  </p>
  <p>More simply, it refers to making computers and robots that learn how to think and act like humans.
  </p>
  <h3>Generative AI
  </h3>
  <p>Executive Order 14110 defines “Generative AI” as:
  </p>
  <p>“the class of AI models that emulate the structure and characteristics of input data in order to generate derived synthetic content. This can include images, videos, audio, text, and other digital content.”
  </p>
  <p>The Government Accountability Office defines Generative AI as:
  </p>
  <p>“technology that can create content, including text, images, audio, or video, when prompted by a user. Generative AI systems create responses using algorithms that are trained often on open-source information, such as text and images from the internet. However, generative AI systems are not cognitive and lack human judgment.”
  </p>
  <h3>Cloud
  </h3>
  <p>NIST defines “Cloud Computing” as:
  </p>
  <p>“a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.”
  </p>
  <p>We tend to think of the “cloud” as the interconnected network of servers in data centers where information, data and software are stored and accessed.<span style="font-size: 1rem;"></span>
  </p>
  <h3>Application Programming Interface (API)
  </h3>
  <p>NIST defines “API” as:
  </p>
  <p>“A system access point or library function that has a well-defined syntax and is accessible from application programs or user code to provide well-defined functionality.”
  </p>
  <p>Simply, APIs are digital tools that act like translators or docks, allowing two pieces of software to easily exchange data with one another.
  </p>
  <h3>Machine Learning
  </h3>
  <p>Executive Order 14110 defines “Machine Learning” as:
  </p>
  <p>“A set of techniques that can be used to train AI algorithms to improve performance at a task based on data.”
  </p>
  <p>Basically machine learning is about creating software that can, without too much human interaction, analyze data, find patterns and develop its own way of “thinking.”

  <h2>1.2 Basic Overview of Generative AI
  </h2>
  <p>Here is a simplified crash course into Generative Artificial Intelligence or “GenAI.”
  </p>
  <h4>Type ahead is a simple example of artificial intelligence.
  </h4>
  <p>We’ve all seen the basic version of artificial intelligence in computers and smartphones.
  </p>
  <p>When we are writing an email or composing a text message the software suggests what the next word we might want to type is. That “type ahead” feature is an example of basic artificial intelligence in action.
  </p>
  <p>Type ahead relies on the most fundamental building block of Generative AI tools, called “fundamental models.” Simply put these models are pieces of software that represent the way we as humans think as hundreds of lines of computer code, data and algorithms.
  </p>
  <p>Type ahead uses one of these fundamental models to predict your next word based on what most people have written and what you’ve written in other sentences.
  </p>
  <p>Pretty simple, right? Let’s keep going.
  </p>
  <h4>The Rise of Large Language Models
  </h4>
  <p>We can now go much farther than simple type ahead or word suggestions.
  </p>
  <p>That’s because in the last few years we’ve created more sophisticated artificial intelligence models. These new models have learned how we construct sentences, paragraphs and longer pieces of writing.
  </p>
  <p>The creators of these models gathered trillions of pieces of written language, from encyclopedia entries and literature to social media posts and song lyrics. They used all that data to “train” their models.
  </p>
  <p>Those humans wrote computer code and “algorithms” that looked at every word and phrase and analyzed how they connect to one another: What do those words mean? Which words tend to show up near others? What words are used in which contexts?
  </p>
  <p>The algorithms looked for patterns and statistics in the interrelationships of words and phrases. And the software kept track of the results.
  </p>
  <p>All of that together created a powerful kind of fundamental model called a “Large Language Model” or LLM.
  </p>
  <h4>From LLMs to GenAI
  </h4>
  <p>This is where things got really interesting.
  </p>
  <p>The human model creators also figured out how to build those LLMs to get really good at responding to simple human questions and prompts. The LLMs could interpret the language that a person was inputting, understand what it should do and serve back a response.
  </p>
  <p>So they built simple chat interfaces that like text messages would allow someone to write a simple prompt or question and have the tool respond.
  </p>
  <p>The tool wouldn’t just search all the trillions of pieces of written language information in its memory and serve up potential answers. It would actually use its understanding of language to create new phrases and sentences and give an answer. The artificial intelligence system would generate content; hence, Generative AI.
  </p>
  <p>Another big benefit of the chat interface has been that someone could ask the system to improve the output in specific ways: make the tone more friendly, use fewer bullets, say more about this specific issue referencing the events of the last few months. In this way, humans can keep shaping and refining the output from Generative AI systems. And after a few rounds of refinement, we can get something very close to what we want.
  </p>
  <p>(Note: Large Language Models nowadays are often called Generative Pre-Trained Transformers or GPTs. Pairing a “Chat” function with a “GPT” is what gave the popular GenAI product its name. While GPTs and LLMs are technically different, you can think of them as about the same for the purpose of GenAI acquisition.)
  </p>
  <h4>Beyond Text
  </h4>
  <p>From there companies and researchers started creating other kinds of fundamental models and teaching them to learn how to analyze and find patterns in different inputs.
  </p>
  <p>People started feeding the new models photographs and paintings, songs and speeches, videos and animation, computer code and numerical data. And the models learned how these kinds of content worked.
  </p>
  <p>With a similar chat-based interface it became pretty easy to now ask for more than a written text response. Now these fundamental models could generate images, music, movies and smartphone apps.
  </p>
  <p>As time goes on and models get better, the ability of these artificial intelligence tools to generate more sophisticated content has only increased.
  </p>
  <h2>1.3 Unique Benefits of Generative AI
  </h2>
  <h4>Create and Refine Content
  </h4>
  <p>Probably the biggest value that Generative AI tools offer is the ability to create text, pictures, sounds, videos and even computer code.
  </p>
  <p>The best GenAI tools will mine the information available in its training data or on the internet, much like a search engine, then combine it with its own pattern-making to construct sentences, paragraphs, graphics and other outputs.
  </p>
  <p>Users then have the ability to shape, refine and adjust the outputs to make them what users want and need. This allows a user to make rough prototypes, first drafts and initial passes at content very quickly then spent time editing, curating, adjusting and refining rather than having to create from a blank page.
  </p>
  <h4>Easy, Chat-Based Interface
  </h4>
  <p>Generative AI systems typically respond to questions and requests that a person types into a chat or text box. The GenAI tools then create text, pictures, sounds or videos to respond to those prompts.
  </p>
  <p>The person can then refine and improve the output by typing more specific directions or guidance into the prompt box and the GenAI tool can iterate what it created to better suit what the person wants.
  </p>
  <p>Interestingly, there is a growing area of expertise called “prompt engineering” describing people’s skills in crafting the right words, context, examples and guidance to type into chat interfaces to iterate and get the right output from different GenAI systems.
  </p>
  <h4>Customize How They Work
  </h4>
  <p>Generative AI tools often allow both programmers and end users to alter them. People can train a model using different data so it can learn the patterns of specific kinds of information. This can be especially useful if an organization wants to use the Generative AI tool for a specific purpose.
  </p>
  <p>For example, an agency could train a model using its own agency policies, data, regulations and action with the goal that the model would provide more agency-specific outputs.
  </p>
  <p>Models can also be “fine tuned,” meaning you can change how the model works, adjusting what it should treat as more important or less important. You can even change what it outputs to make it more relevant, such as following a particular style of writing or imagery.
  </p>
  <p>And if no existing model seems to come close you can create your own model then train it with custom data, fine tune how it works and tailor the outputs to meet your specific needs.
  </p>
  
  
  <h2>1.4. Risks of Generative AI
  </h2>
  <h4>Misinformation and Disinformation
  </h4>
  <p>Generative AI can create highly realistic but false content, such as “deepfakes” – images, audio, video or text which make it look like someone said or did something they didn’t. This can be used to spread falsehoods that polarize people, destabilize communities and even incite crimes.
  </p>
  <h4>AI Hallucinations
  </h4>
  <p>Generative AI models can produce incorrect or nonsensical outputs, often because of limitations in their training data or algorithms. These “hallucinations” can lead to misinformation, incorrect decisions, misinterpretations, which can lead to flawed policy decisions or misinformed public statements.
  </p>
  <h4>Bias and Fairness in Public Services
  </h4>
  <p>AI systems, if they have been trained on discriminatory or one-sided data, can lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes in public services. Importantly, E.O. 14110 charges Chief Artificial Intelligence Officers (CAIOs) with ensuring their agency’s AI will advance equity, dignity, and fairness.
  </p>
  <h4>Prompt Manipulation
  </h4>
  <p>There is a risk of biased or misleading outputs, especially if the prompts people input contain incorrect or slanted information. Malicious actors could exploit this to generate harmful content, spread disinformation, or extract sensitive data.
  </p>
  <h4>Regulatory and Legal Compliance
  </h4>
  <p>The use of generative AI must be carefully evaluated to ensure compliance with policies such as E.O. 14110 and the NIST AI Risk Management Framework to include considerations around transparency, accountability, and ethical use.
  </p>
  <p>Security/Cybersecurity Risks
  </p>
  <p>Generative AI can be exploited for cyber-attacks, including sophisticated phishing and malware that evades detection, and is vulnerable to adversarial attacks aimed at manipulating outputs. Insecure AI systems risk data theft and sabotage, undermining public trust and national security.
  </p>
  <h4>Privacy Risks
  </h4>
  <p>Generative AI’s need for extensive data raises concerns over inadvertent privacy breaches and the ethical use of personal information. It poses risks of unauthorized surveillance and synthetic data creation that infringes on privacy rights, necessitating strict data protection and privacy law compliance.
  </p>
  <h4>Intellectual Property and Plagiarism
  </h4>
  <p>Generative AI raises complex issues regarding copyright infringement and originality. This poses significant challenges for determining the ownership and originality of AI-generated works.
  </p>
  <h4>Environmental
  </h4>
  <p>Similar to cloud computing, training and operating large AI models requires substantial computational resources, leading to significant electricity usage. Additionally, the production and disposal of the specialized computing hardware (like GPUs and CPUs) necessary for AI development involve resource-intensive processes and contribute to electronic waste. This environmental impact is compounded by the infrastructure needs of data centers, including land usage and cooling systems.
  </p>
  <h4>Model Training Delay
  </h4>
  <p>Since there is a time lag between when the model is trained and when the model is used there is a risk that the model doesn’t reflect current norms, regulations, or realities, which could cause the AI to generate irrelevant or inappropriate outputs.
  </p>
  <h2>1.5 Typical Generative AI Tools
  </h2>
  
  <h3>1.5.1 Types of Tools
  </h3>
  <p>So what kind of Generative AI tools exist right now that an agency may want to buy or get access to? Here are a few examples and how they might be used by an agency.
  </p>
  
  <h4>Generative AI Features and Functions in Other Software
  </h4>
  <p>Generative AI is being embedded in commercial products by leveraging the data from their software to enhance and expand functionality available for customers. As an example, customer relationship software is being enhanced with generative AI to more rapidly respond to inquiries, identify potential sales and revenue opportunities, and personalize interactions with customers.
  </p>
  
  <h4>LLMs via API
  </h4>
  <p>In cases where you may want to integrate a commercial LLM into your own applications, this can allow for
  </p>
  
  <h4>Image / Sound / Video Generators
  </h4>
  
  <h4>ChatBots
  </h4>
  <p>Programs or tools based on LLMs that respond to human interactions and inquiries with text that simulates human language. Generative AI ChatBots are capable of answering a series of related questions or prompts in a conversational tone. These can be used to respond to customer inquiries on policies, services and products.
  </p>
  
  <h4>Custom GPTs
  </h4>
  <h4>These are personalized versions of a Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT) where the user has the ability to tailor the AI model specific to a particular topic or task. This is accomplished when the user combines a specific architecture, domain subject matter expertise, and domain specific training data to produce a more specialized or targeted set of results from the tool.
  </h4>
  
  <h4>Knowledge extraction and text summarization
  </h4>
  
  <h4>Text to image generation
  </h4>
  <p>Allows an end user to quickly produce images and visuals by describing images in text prompts. These tools can enhance the creation of diagrams, illustrations, and graphics for use in training materials and product guides.
  </p>
  
  <h4>Language translation
  </h4>
  <p>Tools which use natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to analyze text and data sets in multiple languages to recognize how the words influence each other, which allows them to communicate the meaning of phrases in different languages. These can be useful for agencies needing quick draft translations of general materials into multiple languages.
  </p>
  
  <h4>Coding assistants
  </h4>
  <p>Tools using LLMs and Natural Language Processing to assist in refactoring legacy code, translate code from one language to another, find and use appropriate code libraries, detect errors in code and recommend changes, and translate natural language into code. Primarily used to assist programmers, they can reduce time to develop or modernize code.

  </ul>
  
  <h2 id="chapter2">2. Generative AI in the Government</h2>
  
  <p>GenAI tools can enhance accuracy and precision by automating and refining data processing, analysis, and decision-making processes, all while reducing human errors in data entry, analysis, and interpretation. In processing vast amounts of data, GenAI algorithms can identify patterns and anomalies with a level of accuracy beyond human capability. This leads to more accurate insights for policy making, operational planning, and service delivery. Additionally, AI-driven tools can ensure consistency in communications and reporting, further enhancing the reliability of information disseminated by federal agencies.
  </p>
  
  <h2>2.1 Generative AI in Government Examples
  </h2>
  <p>By providing accurate predictive analytics, GenAI also aids in better forecasting and scenario planning, crucial for strategic decision-making across various sectors of government operations. Here are a few examples of how the Government is currently using Generative AI:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h4>DHS Using Commercial Generative AI for Text, Image and Code Generation
      </h4>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>DHS employees are permitted to use commercially available Generative AI for day-to-day work including generating first drafts of documents that a human would subsequently review, conducting and synthesizing research on open-source information, developing briefing materials, dynamically creating graphical content through text prompts, and creating usable computer code. (Reference: <a class="external_link" href="https://www.dhs.gov/data/AI_inventory">https://www.dhs.gov/data/AI_inventory</a>)
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h4>FEMA Hazard Mitigation Plan Creation Tool
      </h4>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>FEMA will launch a GenAI pilot to create efficiencies for the hazard mitigation planning process for local governments, including underserved communities. Hazard mitigation plans are not only a foundational step that communities can take to build their resilience but can be lengthy to produce and challenging for communities that lack resources to do so. The pilot will specifically support State, Local, Tribal, and Territorial governments’ understanding of how to craft a plan that identifies risks and mitigation strategies as well as generate draft plan elements—from publicly-available, well-researched sources — that governments could customize to meet their needs. This pilot could lead to more communities having the ability to submit grant applications for funding to become more resilient and reduce disaster risks.

  </ul>
  <p>National Institute of Health’s National Library of Medicine developed a Large-Language Model to help match patients to clinical trials based on physicians’ notes. The system looked at trial restrictions and assessed patient eligibility to identify who might be good candidates and who might need to be excluded. The initial experiments of TrialGPT were run on data from 184 patients and 18,238 annotated clinical trials. (Reference: <a class="external_link" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15051">[2307.15051] Matching Patients to Clinical Trials with Large Language Models (arxiv.org)</a>)
  </p>
  
  <p>Many other agencies have begun their AI journeys with pilots and experiments. The Federal Reserve Board has started a Generative AI “incubator” that is looking at testing hypotheses and seeing how different solutions perform. They have data from all the different payment systems they oversee that could provide insights about opportunities and problems in the customer experience. NASA has begun running experiments using Generative AI systems to help write computer code, saving software programmers time by taking the first shot and doing some initial heavy lifting that humans can then focus on reviewing, improving, testing and transforming.

  <h2 id="chapter3">3. Generative AI Procurement</h2>
 <p>Acquiring Generative AI solutions can look very similar to other complex software acquisitions.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <h2>3.1 Start with your agency’s needs.
  </h2>
  <p>There are many different types of Generative AI products and services, each with their own strengths.
  </p>
  
  <p>Don’t jump to a particular solution. Instead, begin by understanding what program staff want to do and achieve, then find the right solutions and suppliers that will best help them.
  </p>
  
  <p>Clearly define what the agency aims to achieve with AI, focusing on specific problems you want to solve with Generative AI, the opportunities you want to pursue, the gaps of current tools and the desired outcomes.
  </p>
  
  <h2>3.2. Assemble a cross-agency team.
  </h2>
  <p>AI procurement is not just a procurement or IT department task.
  </p>
  
  <p>Create an Integrated Product Team (IPT) drawing from across the organization. Structure these teams similar to a modern software team, applying agile development principles.

  <h3>3.2.1 Integrated Product Teams for GenAI Projects
  </h3>
  <p>Integrated Product Teams are successful because each role brings different perspectives and knowledge. Led by a technical program manager, the team should consist of program staff who can voice needs and advocate for the agency’s mission, AI practitioners, software engineers, data engineers, security experts, privacy officials and acquisition professionals. Finance, legal and other representatives will need to be brought in along the way. Their main goals should be to set the project objectives and constraints, research and vet solutions, and identify potential risks and consequences.
  </p>
  
  <p>The team should address these types of issues:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Consider the interoperability of AI solutions with existing systems and data to maximize utility and efficiency.</li>
    <li>Data rights</li>
    <li>Intellectual property provisions</li>
    <li>End-user licensing agreements</li>
    <li>Appropriations implications for different types of pricing</li>
    <li>The extent that software or hardware must be integrated into the existing infrastructure</li>
    <li>Security measures that must be complied with to start a pilot or scale a solution</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>3.2.2 Understand how your agency already uses Generative AI.
  </h3>
  <p>Link to the data dashboard.
  </p>
  
  <h2>3.3 Scope and test solutions.
  </h2>
  <p>It’s often difficult to know which Generative AI tool will be best for your agency’s purposes. That’s why it’s always best to spend time actually trying them out first. See which tools have the right combinations of functions and features that work with the data you have and help you get to the goals you want to achieve.
  </p>
  <p>“Sandboxes” are test beds that agencies can use to experiment with Generative AI tools. Think of them as low scale versions of tech you are exploring. These sandboxes allow you to try different tools and identify which ones work best for your agency’s needs. They can also help you more accurately estimate the amount of effort and cost it might take to complete the project.
  </p>
  <p>A subset of the Integrated Product Team (IPT) can bring their expertise in data, workflows and security to scope the sandbox and begin running tests with actual data and different GenAI tools. They can then assess which tools will best fit their goals and what tools or access to tools the agency should acquire.
  </p>
  
  <p>Typically setting up and using these sandboxes can happen under the Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT).
  </p>
  
  
  
  <p>Use results to figure out what a scale model might look like by identifying where use cases can be managed, what skills are needed, whether the experiment can be scaled and what would be needed to do that.
  </p>
  
  <p>Results can indicate acquisition approach (COTS, tailored model, build a model from scratch) and the associated cost drivers for estimates
  </p>
  
  <h2>3.4 Specify how data will be used.
  </h2>
  <p>Understand your own data sets and potential shortcomings of the data set.
  </p>
  
  <p>Data Privacy and Security: Prioritize data privacy and security in all generative AI applications, safeguarding sensitive information.
  </p>
  
  <p>Ensure that AI solutions comply with federal cybersecurity standards and data protection regulations.

  <h2>3.5 Create an acquisition strategy.
  </h2>
  <p>Develop a procurement strategy that considers the unique aspects of AI technology, such as the need for ongoing updates, model training, and customization.
  </p>
  <h3>3.5.1 The fastest acquisition may be no acquisition.
  </h3>
  <p>Your agency might be able to access Generative AI solutions without doing an acquisition. Here are a few ways to do that.
  </p>
  
  <h4>3.5.1.2 From public web tools you can already access
  </h4>
  <p>Many providers offer basic Generative AI tools and services from a freely available public page or a search page. If your agency staff’s Generative AI needs are basic, consider using one of these basic, free tools.
  </p>
  
  <h4>3.5.1.3 In software you already have
  </h4>
  <p>Lots of software packages have basic Generative AI functionality built in. Before you start a new acquisition, check with your agency’s IT group. You may already have access to the right AI tools within your existing software.
  </p>
  
  <h4>3.5.1.4 Via a cloud platform you already use
  </h4>
  <p>Many of the major cloud platforms and “hyperscalers” provide access to Generative AI tools as modules from right within their platforms. Agency staff might be able to use their current cloud platform account and credits to pay for and use those modules.
  </p>
  <h5>3.5.1.4.1 Accessing AI tools via a cloud platform
  </h5>
  <p>If your agency already has access to a cloud platform it might be easy to access Generative AI tools. Some steps you may need to go through with your program office include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>State your needs, requirements and asks.</li>
    <li>Identify the relevant points of contact in the CIO organization. This should include CISO, CAIO, and CIO staff.</li>
    <li>Establish a clear set of guidelines for your planned project or experiment.</li>
    <li>Locate how your agency has relevant Cloud platform is on contract for your agency today, which office(s) own that contract, and what the terms and conditions are. In many cases, the contract and the contracting officer are assigned to the CIO organization.</li>
    <li>Work with the COR and CO team to develop a cost estimate based on the pricing in the contract.
      <ul>
        <li>In some cases, the platform is accessed through a contract with a Value Added Reseller. Depending on the potential scope of the contract and the efforts, there may be management costs for the vendor in addition to the credits needed to stand up the environment.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Use a formalized process for getting risk management approval from our OCIO as eo stipulates AI use cases need to be risk managed by contract authorities or agency IT. If there is not yet a formalized process, document your approvals from the relevant agency officials.</li>
    <li>In the case of some vendors, you will need to request permission to access these capabilities since there may only be a beta version available for federal environments.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h4>3.5.1.5 From a system integrator already on contract
  </h4>
  <p>A growing number of IT system integrators have built Generative AI tools and interfaces to others’ tools. Agency staff can sometimes access such tools through a custom portal or from software that the SIs have deployed. Depending on their contract and task order, an SI might already be able to provide or build a custom solution to provide access to Generative AI tools.

  <h2>3.7 Estimate costs
  </h2>
  <h3>3.7.1 Generative AI tools are sold like software.
  </h3>
  <p>Most commercial Generative AI tools are considered “software” so they tend to be sold the way most software is sold and priced nowadays. Agencies pay fees for software in three main ways: subscriptions, usage and feature tiers.
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h4>Subscriptions
      </h4>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Agency pays per month or year for each account that renews at the end of the term until canceled, regardless of how much you use the model. Think of this like the fee you might pay for a video streaming service: you can watch as much as you want for a flat fee per month or per year.
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h4>Usage
      </h4>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Agency pays per the amount of data inputted or outputted, the time or resources used on a particular platform or the quality of output. Think of this like the fee you might pay for a rideshare: you pay for the length of the trip, the time the trip takes and a little more if a lot of people are trying to get rides at the same time.
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h4>Feature Tiers
      </h4>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Agency pays once per the group of functions and features regardless of consumption/usage or number of users. Think of this like the one-time fee you might pay for a membership: you pay one fee to the club which entitles you to lifetime benefits and if you pay a higher fee you get more benefits like access to exclusive sales.
  </p>
  
  <p>Generative AI tools typically charge some combination of these fees. Here are a few examples based on real life cases:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>A reseller charges an agency $20 per month per user for email, word processing, spreadsheets and presentations programs and apps. They charge an additional $20 per month for Generative AI features and functions in these same programs and apps.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <ul>
    <li>A company offers the ability to “train” an AI model charges an agency a base rate per month for an account plus a $10 per million credits or tokens where each token represents an individual word of “training data” that the agency uploads.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <ul>
    <li>A cloud platform provider charges a certain amount to get access to an AI model but then charge the agency for every minute they use the model or for every time they access a database that the model connects to.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3.7.3 Developing estimates for using Generative AI tools
  </h3>
  <p>Costs for generative AI tools can add up quickly so understanding your agency’s use cases, desired outcomes, and internal policies are an essential starting point for developing estimates. Generative AI tools and LLMs continue to be trained and evolve as companies and product end users identify and refine use cases and capabilities which can be enhanced with generative AI.
  </p>
  
  <p>Using the table in section 3.6.2 as a reference, identify which “model” framework is most appropriate for the use case you are contracting for and at least seek to gain answers for the questions related to your use case.
  </p>
  
  <p>Subscription pricing generally is straightforward, estimating the number of users and the costs. As generative AI tools are new and companies are still figuring out their own costs and revenues these rates may change, these costs may change. Though you should always try to negotiate for discounts from listed prices, companies are rarely offering reduced prices for tools at this time so listed prices are realistic for estimating purposes.
  </p>
  
  <p>When accessing generative AI tools through a usage based model, you will need to account for any type of access costs in addition to actual usage. For example, if you are accessing a generative AI tool through your Cloud provider’s architecture and you use a Value Added Reseller (VAR) for that architecture, your estimate will need to include any costs the VAR charges in addition to your usage costs. It is also important to understand and account for any additional access charges your Cloud provider may add on top of their usage costs and the usage costs for the particular generative AI tool.
  </p>
  
  <p>Similar to subscription pricing, estimating costs for software feature tiers is generally straightforward but offerings within tiers and pricing may change more frequently as companies develop and integrate generative AI models and capabilities into their products.
  </p>
  
  <h3>3.7.4 Developing estimates for training, tuning or building generative AI models
  </h3>
  <p>A similar methodology to estimating cloud spend can be used, but additional cost drivers should be factored in.
  </p>
  
  <p>Four of the largest Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) provide cost calculators to assist in estimating a budget and developing a cost estimate. Other CSPs may provide similar tools and serve as a basis for your estimate. Successfully using these tools requires the estimator to have knowledge of the potential workload and types, processing speeds and memory needed as well as the number of users. Consulting with technical experts in your organization and using more than one of the tools when building your estimate is strongly suggested.
  </p>
  
  <p>Setting up an agency “test bed” or “sandbox” for a particular generative AI model and constructing an experiment is one way to understand and estimate potential usage costs.
  </p>
  
  <p>As for monitoring and controlling costs once your contract is in place, our own sandbox experiments with two of the CSPs indicate when you are constructing your technical architecture you have visibility and options on which components you use and the associated costs with the particular components. Ensuring your CORs and your end users communicate often during the development process and operations of the tools will help you manage your spend.
  </p>
  
  <p>An overview on pricing for general Cloud services can be found at the Cloud Information Center: https://cic.gsa.gov/acquisitions/pricing
  </p>
  
  <p>Additional Considerations for estimating: Agencies may find they need to contract for specific services to develop, tune and maintain their models. Contracting officers should reach out to their CAIO’s office to identify the most relevant labor categories or skill sets for the particular requirements if this is needed. Use tools such as GSA’s CALC to help develop estimates if you have an understanding of appropriate labor categories and skill levels.
  </p>
  
  <h2>3.8 Monitor and Evaluate
  </h2>
  <p>Transparency and Accountability
  </p>
  <p>Maintain transparency in AI operations and establish clear accountability mechanisms.
  </p>
  
  <p>Clarify the roles and responsibilities of vendors, particularly if a use case has an impact on citizen rights, entitlements or other benefit programs. Specifically, ensure decisions on rights impacting programs can be contested in accordance with the laws, statues and regulations governing the program.
  </p>
  
  <p>AI implementation can lead to significant changes in workflows. Prepare your team for these changes with appropriate planning, training and support.
  </p>
  
  <p>AI technologies evolve rapidly. Regularly review and adjust your AI strategies to ensure they remain effective and aligned with your agency’s goals.
  </p>
  
  <p>Scalability and Flexibility: Look for procurement vehicles that offer scalability and flexibility to adapt as AI technologies evolve.
  </p>
  
  <p>Ensure organizational roles and responsibilities are defined to continually evaluate and monitor the outputs of generative AI capabilities.
  </p>
  
  <p>Regularly monitor and evaluate generative AI systems to ensure they meet performance and ethical standards.
  </p>
  
<h2 id="chapter4">4. Acquisition Methods and Vehicles</h2>
<p>The federal government has a variety of procurement options and vehicles to help agencies purchase Generative AI solutions. Below is a list of some procurement options that you may wish to consider as you are planning your acquisition. You may also wish to visit our dashboard to gather data regarding what vehicles and strategies have been used historically.
  </p>

  <h2>GSA Multiple Award Schedules (MAS) IT
  </h2>
  <p>Define what MAS is
  </p>
  <p>The General Services Administration (GSA) Multiple Award Schedules (MAS) IT provides easy ways for agencies to purchase information technology services and products. Agencies can find pre-vetted vendors offering AI and machine learning solutions. MAS IT is best for ___________________________.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Contracts
  </h2>
  <p>For defense-related AI projects, DISA offers contracts that cater specifically to the needs of the Department of Defense and its affiliates, ensuring that solutions meet stringent security and performance standards. DISA contracts are most useful for ______________.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Tradewinds
  </h2>
  <p>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
  </p>
  
  <h2>Agency-Specific Contracts
  </h2>
  <p>Some agencies have their own contracting vehicles designed to meet unique requirements, which can be an efficient way to procure AI solutions tailored to specific missions.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Public-Private Partnerships
  </h2>
  <p>Collaborating with private sector entities can provide access to cutting-edge AI technologies and expertise, offering a path to innovative solutions through cooperative research and development agreements.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Interagency Agreement
  </h2>
  <p>Interagency agreements are authorized by the Economy Act , which allows agencies to enter into agreements to obtain supplies or services from another agency. For more information, please review FAR 17.502-2 The Economy Act and <a class="external_link" href="http://uscode.house.gov/browse.xhtml;jsessionid=114A3287C7B3359E597506A31FC855B3">31 U.S.C.1535: Agency Agreements</a>.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Other Transaction Authority (OTA)
  </h2>
  <p>Some agencies have the authority to enter into a non-FAR based legal agreement called an Other Transaction Authority (OTA) that leverages commercial buying practices. Typically OTAs are utilized to procure state-of-the-art technology solutions from non-traditional vendors. Please note: There are programs to bring non-traditional emerging tech vendors onto government wide acquisition vehicles such as the Vendor Outreach Program at GSA ITC.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Commercial Solutions Opening (CSO)
  </h2>
  <p>CSOs are similar to Broad Agency Announcements (BAAs) which are used for Research and Development (R&amp;D) however CSO are set up for innovative commercial solutions. Typically a phased acquisition approach is used where a problem statement is provided by the government through a Statement of Objectives (SOO) and vendors submit white papers on their approach to solve the problem. After a technical evaluation and based on funding requirements prototypes and simulations are funded and potentially follow-on contracts.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Prize Competitions
  </h2>
  <p>One way that agencies can begin to explore harnessing Artificial Intelligence is through prize based competitions. Challenge.Gov platform is the central hub for prize competitions across the U.S. federal government. Through this platform, federal agencies can engage public solvers in prize competitions and crowdsourcing campaigns to identify innovative solutions to important issues.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Government Wide Acquisition Vehicles
  </h2>
  <p>Government-Wide Acquisition Contracts (GWACs) provide access to a wide range of IT solutions, including AI technologies. These contracts streamline the procurement process and offer competitive pricing. When it comes time to buy Generative AI solutions, look at governmentwide Best-in-Class (BIC) acquisition vehicles.
  </p>
  
  <p>Agencies benefit from choosing government-wide contract vehicles because they offer a commitment to meet customer needs, easy access to solutions, cost savings, socio-economic goals, streamlined acquisitions, and compliance with federal regulatory guidance (e.g., FedRAMP). Below are the major government-wide contract vehicles:

<h2 id="chapter6">6.0 Specialized Computing Infrastructure 101</h2>
<h2>6.1 Key Definitions
  </h2>
  
  <h3>Specialized Computing Infrastructure
  </h3>
  <p>The term “Specialized Computing Infrastructure” is used in EO 14110 but not defined.
  </p>
  
  <p>Specialized Computing Infrastructure can be thought of as the high-performance computers, powerful chips, software, networks and resources made specifically for building, training, fine-tuning, testing, using and maintaining artificial intelligence applications.
  </p>
  
  <p>Specialized Computing Infrastructure tends to have…
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Advanced Computer Chips that can run multiple, complex calculations simultaneously.</li>
    <li>Scalable Processing Power giving the ability to quickly access additional chips if even more computational power is needed.</li>
    <li>Enhanced Data Storage and Memory to save, access and manage large sets of information.</li>
    <li>Fast Networking to transfer data at high-speeds among systems with minimal errors and little delay or “latency.”</li>
    <li>Sophisticated Software Tools that engineers can use to write computer code, program algorithms and adjust models.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>6.2 Government Specialized Computing Infrastructure for AI
  </h2>
  
  <p>Government systems also need to have the right security protocols, integration with existing systems and energy efficiency.

  <h2>xxxxxxxxxx.
  </h2>
  <p>Procuring AI solutions, particularly generative AI models, requires a nuanced approach compared to traditional software subscriptions.
  </p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>Determine the nature of AI’s role in the project.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>AI projects can be just a piece of a larger program, such as _____. In other projects, AI is the crux of a program, such as_____. These two types of AI projects represent different project lifecycles.
  </p>
  
  <p>(here we can choose projects from the AI Use Case directory and compare them as images or in a table)
  </p>
  
  <p>There are noticeable similarities between the two figures. In both cases the AI/ML solution will need its scope of work defined normally through a Performance Work Statement (PWS), Statement of Objectives (SOO), or Statement of Work (SOW), depending on the level of requirement specificity. The AI or ML requirements will be placed on a contract (to be further analyzed in later sections of this guidebook); however it is important to note that in Project Type 1, the prime contractor may source the work to a third party, also known as subcontracting.
  </p>
  
  <p>Another important distinction to make is that while in Project Type 2, the development/integration/test of the AI/ML solution can be accomplished discretely, Project Type 1 will require the AI/ML solution to record its own developmental testing as a sub-system before it is joined with the larger system. Once integrated, the complete system may need to undergo both developmental and operational testing.
  </p>
  
  <ol start="2">
    <li>Understand the types of AI you want</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>Broadly, there are three basic types of AI:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>predictive, or classic</li>
    <li>AI ops</li>
    <li>generative AI, also called large language model AI</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>As such, it is crucial to involve a contracting team that can use their experience and contracting tools to conduct research in conjunction with the Program Manager.”
  </p>
  
  
  
  
  
  <p>As an acquisition professional supporting a program office, you should work closely with your technical and program leads to understand the desired outcomes of the generative AI project if your program is working directly with models.
  </p>
  
  <p>Commercially available models can be trained on a variety of data sets and sources and pricing lists can be overwhelming and confusing.
  </p>
  
  <p>In addition to understanding the use cases, you will need to have an understanding of the sensitivity
  </p>
  
  <p>You will need to understand the expected amount of data to be consumed by the model(s) and the expected volume of data produced by the model. If the model needs to be “tuned” or further trained, you will need to know the size of the data set the program will be using to “tune” the model.
  </p>
  
  <p>If your outputs need to include images or sounds it is important to understand the quality of the images and sounds needed to suit the purpose of the model.
  </p>
  
  <p>If your use case needs a very precise or high fidelity model, this will affect the choices of models you can consider and will increase the cost to modify and to operate.
  </p>
  
  <p>Accessing pre-trained models and building your own models are often done through a Cloud Service Provider (CSP).
  </p>
  
  <p>The newness of the technology and costs associated with developing and training generative AI tools is a factor in how companies are pricing generative AI capabilities.
  </p>
  
  <p>It is important to have an ongoing dialog with program and technical leads to understand their use cases, size of the project and potential future deployments.
  </p>
  
  <p>This method is generally best when your program or technical leads have a well defined and specific need for a particular set of capabilities a commercial software tool can provide.
  </p>
  
  
  
  <p>Consider the following factors when considering to acquire a Generative AI solution:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Generative AI Models (e.g., public vs custom)</li>
    <li>Pricing Models (e.g., features, subscription, and usage fees )</li>
    <li>Hosting your Generative AI Model (e.g., on-premise, cloud, SaaS)</li>
    <li>Ownership of Generative AI content</li>
    <li>Liability and indemnification</li>
    <li>Integration with other applications</li>
    <li>Usage (e.g., number of inputs/outputs, number of users)</li>
    <li>Data Security and Sensitivity</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Your goal is to acquire AI technology in a way that meets program and agency needs while ensuring security, compliance, and ethical use, aligning with the broader objectives of the federal government.
  </p>
  
  <h4>Questions to ask when buying genAI
  </h4>
  <ol>
    <li>How is the model going to be delivered? SaaS, OnPrem, etc.</li>
    <li>Which applications do you want to integrate with?</li>
    <li>How many workflows do you need?</li>
    <li>Where will the capability be set up?</li>
    <li>Estimated number of employees/users/agents and their different roles</li>

  <p>When procuring generative AI models and related services, it’s essential to navigate the complex landscape of federal acquisition regulations carefully:
  </p>
  
  <p>Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR): Understand how FAR applies to AI procurement, particularly concerning data rights, intellectual property, and cybersecurity requirements. Sections of FAR that may be particularly relevant to AI procurement include Part 12 (Acquisition of Commercial Items) and Part 39 (Acquisition of Information Technology).
  </p>
  
  <p>Executive Order Requirements: Align procurement processes with the directives outlined in the relevant Executive Orders on AI, ensuring compliance with federal guidelines for AI use and development.
  </p>
  
  <p>NIST Standards: Adhere to NIST standards for AI, which provide a framework for managing risks associated with AI technologies.
  </p>
  <p>Agency Policies and Practices: xxxxxxxxxxxxx
  </p>
  
  <p>Changes to the FAR, EO, OMB, <a class="external_link" href="https://www.congress.gov/search?q=%7B%22congress%22%3A%5B%22118%22%5D%2C%22source%22%3A%22all%22%2C%22search%22%3A%22artificial%20intelligence%22%7D">Legislation</a>, NIST, CISA, own agencies’ policies on IT use.
  </p>
  
  <p>Summary
  </p>
  <p>Be informed: The hype surrounding generative AI is driving businesses to experiment with and seek value through incorporating generative AI into software products where “generative AI” may not be the advertised product you are buying.
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Know why you’re buying a genAI tool and why it will meet the program requirement.</li>
    <li>Understand which genAI tool(s) will meet the program requirement and the “why”</li>
    <li>Don’t overbuy, but build in the ability to scale if needed.</li>
    <li>Unused genAI capabilities can be expensive and take away from understanding whether the capabilities actually enhance business/customer value.</li>
  </ul>
